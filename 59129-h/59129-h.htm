<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> present account of the early history of English poor relief
is chiefly derived from the municipal records of London
and Norwich and from the reports of the justices of the peace
which are included amongst the state papers. Information on
the subject is also contained in the Privy Council Register,
while some of the orders of both Privy Council and justices and
a few of the overseers' accounts are to be found in the collections
of the British Museum.</p>

<p>A fairly effectual system of relieving the destitute by public
authority has had in England a continuous existence since the
seventeenth century. Attempts to found such a system of poor
relief in the sixteenth century were common to most of the
countries of Western Europe, but the continued existence of
any organisation of the kind is peculiar to England.</p>

<p>Possibly this fact has an important influence on our national
history. We are apt to consider the facts that we are a law-abiding
people and that we have not suffered from violent revolutions
to be entirely due to the virtues of the national character and
the excellence of the British Constitution. But before the
introduction of our system of relieving the poor we were by no
means so free from disorder. The poor laws themselves were
at least partly police measures, and, until they were successfully
administered, the country was repeatedly disturbed by rebellions
and constantly plagued by vagrants. The connection between
the relief of the poor and orderly government in England
appears fully during the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and it may be that our legal system of poor relief has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
ever since contributed to the absence of violent catastrophes in
our national history.</p>

<p>But although the continuous existence of a system of public
poor relief for nearly three centuries is peculiar to England, the
English organisation was at first only one of a series of similar
systems which began to arise during the sixteenth century in
most of the countries of Europe. Both in England and on the
continent, however, poor laws were difficult to administer. On
the continent they fell gradually into abeyance, and the English
system of poor relief was by no means enforced simply because
a poor law was passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It
survived almost alone among the similar organisations of the
time chiefly in consequence of the policy adopted by the Privy
Council in the reign of Charles I. and of the efforts made by
English justices of the peace as a result of that policy.</p>

<p>For nearly a century before the time of Charles I., however,
experiments had been made in the organisation of public poor
relief. Efforts in this direction were first undertaken by the
towns, and the provisions of the earlier English poor laws
appear to have been modelled on pre-existing municipal regulations.
The City of London was apparently the first English
secular authority to organise the public relief of the poor.
Collections by the aldermen at the church doors were decreed
by the Court of Aldermen in 1532: compulsory taxation was
levied by the Common Council as early as 1547, while the
Bishop and citizens persuaded Edward VI. to grant the royal
palace of Bridewell for the creation of the first House of Correction.
Before 1569 legislation also had been fashioned upon
these pre-existing orders and bye-laws of the towns, but neither
statutes nor municipal orders were successful.</p>

<p>Statute succeeded statute throughout the sixteenth century;
during the years 1594 to 1597, however, there was great
scarcity of corn and provisions; the poor died from starvation or
rose in insurrection. The whole question of poor relief was in
consequence thoroughly thrashed out in Parliament. Bacon
and Burleigh, Whitgift and Raleigh took part in the debates.
A great committee appointed in 1597 held its meetings in the
Middle Temple Hall, and there Bacon, Coke, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
distinguished men in the House discussed at least thirteen bills
on the subject. This committee finally rejected all the bills
referred to them in favour of a new bill drafted by themselves
which finally passed into law. This was practically re-enacted
in 1601 and has remained in force until our own time as the
basis of our organisation for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>But the question of poor relief was not settled by statutory
enactment any more than by municipal regulations. Administration
and not legislation has always been the difficulty in
laws concerning the poor. Until the end of the sixteenth
century the history of relief in England is parallel to that of
France and Scotland; there were in all three countries many
poor laws but none were well administered. But in the time
of Charles I. the machinery for the execution of the law is
developed, and henceforward the history of poor relief in
England differs from that of the neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>The machinery for the execution of the law is created by
means of the pressure of the Privy Council on the justices of
the peace. Even in the reign of Elizabeth the Privy Council
had occasionally issued orders with the object of enforcing the
poor law. But from 1629 to 1640 the Privy Council under the
personal government of Charles I. interfered constantly and
regularly in the matter. The Council attempted to provide
work for the unemployed, to procure cheap corn in years of
scarcity, and to regulate wages in the supposed interests of the
workmen. It also established a new organisation for the
ordinary relief of the poor. In 1631 the justices still neglected
to execute the laws for the poor, but the Book of Orders issued
in that year ordered special meetings to be held and reports to
be sent to the Privy Council. Nearly a thousand of these
reports remain, and in these we are told that in many districts
of the kingdom the execution of the law so improved that it
became part of the practice as well as of the law of the
land.</p>

<p>Moreover the whole of the Elizabethan Poor Law was
administered: work was provided for the unemployed, as well
as pensions for the impotent. In most places in south-eastern
England, and in some districts of almost every county, sums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
were levied in order that materials and tools might be furnished
to the unemployed.</p>

<p>Thus during the personal government of Charles I. we have
not only the first thorough execution of the poor law, but a
more complete organisation for the help of the weaker classes
than at any other period of our history.</p>

<p>The system thus established was successful in meeting the
temporary difficulties of the time. Some Shropshire justices
worked "such effect" by the execution of the Book of Orders
that "there have not any rogues or vagabonds appeared amongst
us or walked abroad as wee heare of since our first meetings."
There were also no complaints from the impotent poor, and the
unemployed were set to work. There are similar accounts from
many different parts of the country which show that the administration
of the Poor Law had then much to do with making
England a law-abiding and orderly community.</p>

<p>But the outbreak of the Civil War rendered the finding of
work for the unemployed less necessary, and broke up the
organisation established by the Book of Orders. There are no
reports after 1640, and probably the special meetings of the
justices were discontinued. The whole of the poor law was
laxly administered and only in a few places did this provision
for the unemployed outlast the Commonwealth. Still a part of
the poor law survived and has a continuous history from the
time of Henry VIII. In Scotland and France either the
central government was not so vigilant, or there were no
efficient local officials, and in both these countries therefore
regulations for the relief of the poor were issued but were not
effectually executed. The English organisation alone survived,
and this probably in consequence of the enforcement of the
Book of Orders under the personal government of Charles I.</p>

<p>During my investigations I have received valuable assistance.
To the Rev. Dr Cunningham of Trinity College, Cambridge,
I am especially grateful for much kindly advice and criticism.
I began my researches into this subject while I was a student of
the London School of Economics and desire to express my
obligations to Mr Hewins, the Director of the School, who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
suggested the subject to me, and also pointed out to me some
of the printed sources of information. I also thank Mr Hubert
Hall of the Public Record Office for the ready kindness with
which he has always helped me. Mr Tigny of the Norwich
muniment room, Dr Sharpe of the Guildhall Record Office, and
the officials of the British Museum and Public Record Office
have also courteously assisted me while I was investigating the
manuscripts under their care. My thanks are also due to
Mr S. H. Leonard of Lincoln's Inn, Mr J. L. Burbey of Exeter
College, and Miss Maud Syson of Girton College. I desire also
to express my gratitude to Mr Loch, Sec. of the C. O. S., who,
on behalf of the Syndics of the University Press, made several
suggestions of which I have been glad to avail myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction.</div>

<p>The English system of Poor Relief presents a striking
contrast to the rest of our national institutions. In
most departments of our social organisation, public
control is less extensive in England than in the other countries
of Western Europe. But, in regard to the relief of the poor,
we have adopted an opposite policy. Since the reign of
Charles I., Englishmen have made themselves responsible for
the maintenance of those who are destitute. All, who cannot
obtain food or shelter for themselves or from their nearest
relatives, have a right to relief from compulsory rates levied
upon the rest of the community.</p>

<p>It will be our object, in the following pages, to trace the
growth of this system. We will examine the causes which
led the public authorities of state and town to control the
relief of the poor, and the steps which they took to render its
administration effective and successful. There can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
doubt, that an organisation of this kind was not suddenly
imposed by a single Act of Parliament. Under Henry VIII.,
the first enactment was passed ordering the regular collection
and distribution of alms for the relief of the poor<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, but it was
not until forty years later that the amount to be paid by each
individual was assessed and its payment compulsorily enforced<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
while even after ninety years had elapsed, the English organisation
of poor relief was still irregularly carried out and of little
practical effect<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. Like other and more famous English institutions,
the making and administration of the English Poor Law
was a growth, not a creation. It was during the sixteenth and
early part of the seventeenth centuries that the chief experiments
were made in methods of relieving the poor by secular
public authorities. But, even before that time, the beginnings
of the later organisation may be traced both in the provisions
of the statutes and in the regulations of the towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Anglo-Saxon
times.</div>

<p>We will now briefly consider the chief ways in which public
secular authorities interfered in the relief of the
poor before the sixteenth century. In Anglo-Saxon
times, the administration of poor relief was almost entirely
under the control of the Church. Almsgiving and hospitality
were however inculcated as religious duties of considerable
importance, and there is much to make us think that they were
extensively practised by Anglo-Saxon kings and noblemen.
Bede tells the following story of King Oswald. He was about
to dine sumptuously from a silver dish of dainties one Easter
day, when the servant who distributed relief to the poor came
before him, and told him that there were many needy persons
outside the gate, who were begging some alms of the king.
The king left the dish untasted and ordered the contents to be
carried to the beggars<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. This story incidentally lets us see
that a distribution of alms and a special servant for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>were part of the regular organisation of the household. King
Alfred also, we are told, "bestowed alms and largesses on both
natives and foreigners of all countries<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>," and it was the custom
of the Anglo-Saxon kings to keep open house for several days
and to entertain all comers three times a year, at Christmas,
Easter and Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>But the greater part of the relief of the time was administered
by ecclesiastics. Some help was given to the poor
in famous abbeys like those of Ely, Croyland and Glastonbury<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,
and there were the offerings distributed by the priests. The
nearest approach we have to state interference with the relief
of the poor is found in the law of Ethelred, which probably
enforced the existing custom with regard to tithe. One third
part "of the tithe which belonged to the Church" was to be
given to "Gods poor and needy men in thraldom<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>."</p>

<p>But, from the beginning of the thirteenth century, we find
greater activity in the matter. Two causes seem to have
influenced the secular public authorities of the time to interfere;
first, the desire to repress vagrants, and secondly, the wish
of state and town to control some of the charitable endowments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Labour
statutes.</div>

<p>Many of the regulations, made with the object of repressing
vagrants and able-bodied beggars, were closely connected
with the statutes concerning labour, enacted
from the middle of the fourteenth century onwards.</p>

<p>After the Black Death of 1348-9, labourers were scarce
and wages rose rapidly; a series of enactments was therefore
passed, designed to force every able-bodied man to work, and to
keep wages at the old level.</p>

<p>In the first regulation of this kind, the Ordinance of
Labourers of 1349, the first step is taken towards the national
control of poor relief. The proclamation restrains the liberty
of the giver; the private individual may no longer give to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>whom he chooses. It is provided that no one is to give relief
to able-bodied beggars, and the ground of the prohibition is
expressly stated to be "that they may be compelled to labour
for their necessary living."</p>

<p>The first provision of funds for the relief of the poor made
by law, is embodied in one of the same series of labour statutes.
The wages of priests were regulated and it was ordered that
the fines of those parishioners who paid more than the statutory
rate, should be given to the poor<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as these labour statutes were passed, we
hear that labourers fled from county to county in order to
elude the operation of the law<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. The workmen adopted many
devices, in order to escape from any part of the country where
these regulations were enforced. Some seem to have pretended
to be crippled and diseased, and so, when undetected, could
wander and beg with impunity. Others, apparently, joined
bands of pilgrims, like the famous travellers from the Tabard
to Canterbury, and, journeying with them, would reach a
district, where they could obtain good wages and be undisturbed
by the execution of the labour laws. In 1388, therefore,
regulations were made, restricting the movements, not
only of able-bodied beggars, but of all beggars and of all
labourers and, at the same time, admitting the right to relief
of those who were unable to work for themselves<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. Servants
who wished to depart from the hundred in which they lived,
under colour of going a pilgrimage, or in order to serve or
dwell elsewhere, were to have a letter, stating the cause of
their journey and the time when they were to return, duly
signed by the "good man of the hundred" appointed for the
purpose. If they were found away from their district, without
a letter of this kind, they were to be placed in the stocks and
kept there, until they found surety to return to their own
neighbourhood. However, a servant who had a certain engagement
with a master in another part of the country, was always
to be allowed to have a letter, allowing him freely to depart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Thus the statute prevented a man from wandering about in
search of work, but did not prevent him from migrating, when
an engagement was already concluded. All these regulations
affected beggars: an able-bodied beggar who begged without
a letter was to be put in the stocks in the same manner as a
labourer without a letter. He could not escape by pretending
that he was a labourer, because both were liable to punishment.
Neither could he elude the vigilance of the law, by pretending to
be disabled, because the impotent poor also were forbidden to
wander; they were to stay where they were at the passing of
the Act, or, if the people there were unable to support them,
were to go, within forty days, to other towns in the same
hundred or to the place where they were born.</p>

<p>This statute is often regarded as the first English poor law,
because it recognises that the impotent poor had a right to
relief, and because it carefully distinguishes between them and
the able-bodied beggars. The provisions also imply the responsibility
of every neighbourhood for the support of its own
poor. Moreover, this enactment may be regarded as a law of
settlement. Not only were the impotent poor confined to their
own district, but all unlicensed labourers were likewise forbidden
to migrate. Probably the Act had little effect because
it was too stringent to have been enforced.</p>

<p>Not only Parliament, but the municipal rulers also, made
regulations for the restraint of vagabonds. The authorities of the
City of London, in 1359 and in 1375, forbade any able-bodied
person to beg, and at the end of the fifteenth century the
constables were ordered to search, not only for the vagabonds
themselves, but also for the people who harboured them<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Two statutes relating to beggars and vagabonds were
passed in the reign of Henry VII.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, but in both the severity
of the punishment was decreased, because the king wished
by "softer meanes" to reduce them to obedience. The decrease
in the severity of this punishment seems to show that there
was as yet little sign of the crowds of vagrants, who were a
terror to the country under Henry VIII. So far the wanderers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>were men who had no difficulty in obtaining work, but who
wanted better terms. Under Henry VIII. they include also
unemployed labourers, and the legislation dealing with them
concerns the provision of work for the able-bodied as well as
assistance for the impotent poor; still the regulations concerning
vagrants were already connected with the relief of the poor
because the efforts made to keep at work the valiant beggars
had made it necessary to distinguish between them and the
old and disabled, and had led to some provision being made for
those really unable to help themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Control
of charitable
endowments
by the State.</div>

<p>But there was another cause for the public regulation of
the relief of the necessitous. From the thirteenth
century onwards there are signs that men had
ceased to leave charitable endowments entirely in
the hands of ecclesiastics. A growing desire was felt, that
Parliament and Town Governments should share in the administration
of some of the funds for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>We find indications of this both in the statutes and in
the action of the burgesses. Almost at the same time that
the statute of 1388 ordered beggars to remain in their own
neighbourhood, another statute of Richard II. was passed
which regulated the revenues of the Church in the interests of
the poor. A portion of the tithe had been commonly distributed
by the resident rector to the poor<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, but, when a
living became part of the possessions of a monastery, the poor
parishioners were often forgotten. In order therefore that the
parishioners might not be injured, this enactment provided
that when the revenues of a living were appropriated by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>monastery, a portion of the revenue should be assigned to the
poor, so that they might not lose the alms formerly distributed
by the rectors<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. Under Henry IV. this statute was re-enacted,
and it was ordered that appropriations made since the
15 Rich. II. should be reformed<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The earlier statute had
thus probably not been well observed: the second was apparently
more successful, for in <cite>The Complaynt of Roderyck
Mors</cite>, written in 1542, it is stated that "if the personage were
improperd, the monkes were bound to deale almesse to the
poore and to kepe hospitalyte as the writings of the gyftes of
such personages and landes do playnly declare<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>." In any case
this legislation indicates a desire on the part of the state to
interfere, in order to reform the administration of ecclesiastical
revenues in the interest of the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Control
of charitable
endowments
by the town.</div>

<p>In the towns also, the civic governors and the guilds began
to control some of the endowments for the relief of
the poor. Even in Anglo-Saxon times, the distribution
of alms formed part of the functions of the
guilds, and it is not unlikely that it was partly owing to customs
formed by the municipal rulers through their association in
guilds that the towns began to take an active part in the
administration of poor relief. Thus at Lynn, one of the
ordinances of the town guild provided that relief should be
given to any brother in poverty, either from the common fund
or from the private purses of the guild brothers. A piece of
land was bequeathed to the guild, partly for the purpose of
relieving the poor, and, we are told, £30 a year was distributed
to the poor brethren, to blind, lame and sick persons, and for
other charitable purposes. The whole charity distributed by
this association must have been considerable, for though only
four great meetings of the guild were held during the year,
one of these was especially concerned with the management of
its charities<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. At Sandwich also<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, the burgesses or the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>rulers controlled the two hospitals dedicated respectively to
St Bartholomew and St John. Both were virtually almshouses
providing for a certain number of old people. The Mayor
and Jurats of Sandwich, not only appointed the governors of
St Bartholomew's, but audited the accounts, controlled the
management and appointed new recipients of the charity. The
whole was connected with an annual festal procession to the
hospital in which many of the townsfolk took part<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>At other times, the municipalities, not only exercised control
over institutions founded by private people, but also themselves
contributed to the endowments. At Scarborough, Henry de
Bulmer gave a site for St Thomas hospital which was finished
and endowed by the burgesses<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. At Chester the town gave
land, on condition that certain almshouses were built<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>; and
Ipswich in 1469 granted the profits of St James' fair to the
lazars<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. At Lydd, sums were given for "Goderynges dowghetyr,
pour mayde, for hosyne, shoys and other thyngses" and payments
were made for her clothes and keep on several occasions<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
In this town also gifts of corn were regularly distributed at
Easter and Christmas from 1439 onwards<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>. In most of the
great towns the Chamberlain was the especial guardian of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>orphans<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, and sometimes there was a Court of Orphans in
which matters affecting the property of orphans were managed.
The arrangement rather concerned orphans with property, than
the poor, but still it shows that the municipality recognised a
responsibility with regard to a helpless class of the community.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities at Southampton, however, undertook
much more extensive measures for preventing want, and
it is interesting to notice that this action was very probably
undertaken in consequence of the customs of the ruling guild.
In ordinances at least as early as the fourteenth century forfeits
and alms were awarded to the poor, and members were to be
assisted when in poverty. In the fifteenth century "the townys
almys were settled on a plan," and lists were kept of the weekly
payments. The Steward's book of 1441 states that the town
gave weekly to the poor £4. 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> which, according to the
value of money at the time, might have furnished relief for
about one hundred and fifty people<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Summary.</div>

<p>Thus, before the sixteenth century, state and town had
begun to make regulations for the relief of the
poor. Some of these regulations were dictated by
a desire to repress vagrants. They were closely connected with
the enforcement of the labour legislation of the time, and were
embodied in the same statutes, and administered by the same
officials. But other provisions were due to the fact that there
was a growing tendency for the state to interfere to prevent
the maladministration of ecclesiastical revenues, and for non-ecclesiastical
bodies to undertake the administration of charity.
Still, before the sixteenth century, most of these measures were
negative rather than positive. The orders concerning the
repression of sturdy beggars were more prominent than those
concerning the relief of the poor. The latter were as yet infrequent
and had little practical effect. The main part of the
charity of the time was still administered by ecclesiastics and
was obtained from endowed charities and from voluntary gifts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>But, in the sixteenth century, the older methods of relief
failed to cope with the new social difficulties, and the older
feeling in favour of the ecclesiastical control of charity was
considerably lessened. At the same time, the tendencies that
already led to the management of relief by public secular
authorities were accentuated. During the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, therefore, the organisation of poor relief
was more and more undertaken by municipality and state,
and the English system of poor relief was created and first
administered.</p>

</ul>

<p>The earlier years of the sixteenth century began a period of
great changes in the position of the poorer classes, and these
changes soon resulted in a series of attempts to reform and
reorganise the whole system of poor relief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Increase of
vagrants.</div>
<div class="sidenote">(1) Harman's
description of
the bands of
vagrants in
England.</div>

<p>The desire to repress vagrants had already led state and
town to make regulations concerning the relief of the poor,
but whereas, before the sixteenth century, beggars
were only an occasional nuisance, they now became
a chronic plague. The great increase in the
numbers of these vagabonds appears to have
begun early in the reign of Henry VIII. Thomas Harman, a
gentleman of Kent, in about 1566, wrote an elaborate description
of twenty-three varieties whom he had found to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in existence<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. One of his anecdotes shows that they were
already numerous soon after the execution of the Duke of
Buckingham in 1521<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. A man of some importance, he states,
died about this time, and crowds of beggars attended the
funeral. Some of them were poor householders and these
returned to their homes at night. But the others were
sheltered in a large barn which, on being searched, was found
to contain seven-score men and at least as many women. The
bands of these wanderers continued to increase, for Harrison, in
his <cite>Description of England</cite>, tells us, "it is not yet full threescore
yeares since this trade began: but how it has prospered
since that time it is easie to judge, for they are now supposed,
of one sex and another, to amount to above 10,000 persons<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>."</p>

<p>Harman's description of this "rowsey ragged rabblement
of rakehelles" shows that some sort of organisation existed
amongst them. He prints a slang dictionary of thieves'
language, and states that this had been in existence for thirty
years: he also gives an account of their order of precedence,
thus showing that many degrees of roguery were recognised by
the rogues themselves.</p>

<p>We can see from his account of their pranks, that they were
both cunning and daring, and were often a great hardship to
the honest citizens of the poorer classes.</p>

<p>Not only did they break into houses by night and pilfer the
pigs and the poultry, but they were daring enough to pass a
hook through the windows and draw the clothes off sleeping
men; to rob men on the highway who were travelling home
from fairs, and to come by night to lonely houses and force the
owners to deliver up what money they had on the premises.
Harman's tale on this point may illustrate the dangers of the
situation.</p>

<p>One night two rogues went to an inn, and sat down and
drank merrily, offering the pot to those of the company they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>fancied. Amongst others, a priest was there, and when he had
gone they began to make inquiries of the hostess concerning
him, saying they were nephews of a priest in this neighbourhood
and had not seen him since they were six years old.
She, suspecting no harm, gave them all the information they
wanted; told them the parson kept little company and had
but one woman and a boy in the house. The thieves departed
with the intention of robbing so defenceless a prey, but they
found that his house was built of stone and his windows and
doors well fastened. They thought force would avail little,
and therefore tried fraud. One of the rogues, with piteous
moans, asked for relief, and the parson, being moved by his
distress, put his arm out of window to give him twopence.
The rascal seized, not the twopence, but the priest's hand, and
his companion secured his wrist also, so that their victim
could not liberate himself at all. The rogues demanded three
pounds and succeeded in obtaining four marks which was all
the poor man had in the house. They bound him, therefore,
also to drink twelve pence next day at the inn and to thank
the good wife for the cheer they had had. The unfortunate
parson could only use "contentacion for his remedy," but he
kept his promise, and the hostess persuaded him to say no
more of it "lest when they shal understand of it in the
parish they wyll but laugh you to skorne<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) Vagrants
on the Continent.</div>

<p>This plague of vagrants was not, however, peculiar to
England, but arose about the same time in all the countries
of Western Europe. A book that somewhat
resembled Harman's appeared in Germany as
early as 1514<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>; this contained both an account
of the different orders of vagabonds and also a "Canting Dictionary."
Martin Luther often discussed the subject of beggars,
and in 1528, wrote a preface to this very book<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. In Germany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>therefore, the increase in the number of beggars seems to be
even earlier than in England. In Scotland and the towns of
the Netherlands the statutes and town ordinances show us that
the same trouble assailed them about the same time, and
France in 1516 was already troubled by large numbers of
discharged or wandering soldiers<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Causes
for the existence
of these
bands of
beggars.</div>

<div class="sidenote">(1) The
break-up of
the feudal
system and
consequent
lessening of
employment
in war and
service.</div>

<p>As these bands of vagrants were found in so many countries
at once, the principal causes for their existence
cannot be peculiar to England, or to any one
country, but must be common to all the countries
affected. It was closely connected with lack of
employment: the difficulty had been for the masters to find
workmen, the problem was now for the men to
find work, and this in spite of the fact that at
the beginning of the sixteenth century commerce
and manufactures were rapidly extending. The
age was a time of transition, and old occupations
were becoming unnecessary. The feudal society
of the Middle Ages was giving place to the modern industrial
and commercial community. War, public and private, and
service with great nobles had formerly occupied large numbers
of the male population. But the fifteenth century had witnessed
the growth of central authorities strong enough to
preserve order and to control the power of the great lords.
In Germany, the towns were growing in importance and had
often become independent of feudal superiors; in France,
Louis XI. had overcome the last serious opposition of the
French barons to the growth of the royal authority, while in
England, the Wars of the Roses and the policy of Henry VII.
had combined to break the power of the English nobility.
Order had given place to disorder, lawsuits had succeeded
private wars. The power of the nobles was no longer maintained
by force; they had no longer the need of many followers
to fight their battles. The oft-quoted saying of the chieftain
with reference to the Highlands in the last century might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>applied with little variation to the position of the nobles under
Henry VIII. "When I was a young man the point upon
which every Highland gentleman rested his importance, was
the number of men whom his estate could support, the question
next rested on the amount of his stock of black cattle, it is
now come to respect the number of sheep and I suppose our
posterity will inquire how many rats and mice an estate will
produce<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>." Power in the Highlands then, and in England at
the beginning of the sixteenth century, passed from the leaders
of men to the holders of wealth. This revolution in the basis
of power had a considerable effect upon the labour market.
The chief occupation of the Middle Ages had become unnecessary;
men whom the nobles had formerly been glad to
enlist had now to seek other means of earning a livelihood.
Moreover, the employment which had now disappeared was
one which especially afforded an outlet for men of restless
character, the kind of people who under adverse conditions
became the sturdy vagabonds of the sixteenth century. Sir
Thomas More expressly states that the English thieves of the
time were often discharged retainers<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, and many of the later
idlers would doubtless be men who would have followed this
occupation, if it had been open to them before they took to
their wandering life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) Manufactures
on
a large scale
less stable
than old occupations.</div>

<p>No doubt the growing commerce and manufactures afforded
employment in course of time to many more than
those now displaced by the decrease of private and
public war, but this very increase of manufacturing
industry had effects of its own in increasing the
numbers of the unemployed. In the first place, the peaceful
life of the craftsman was favourable to the growth of population,
and in the second place, the new occupations were less stable
than the old industries had been. The simple manufactures
necessary for the home market varied little; in bad times the
craftsman might get a little less work, but he was not thrown
utterly out of employment. But after great manufacturing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>centres came into existence and their produce began to be exported
to other lands, the inhabitants of whole districts would
have little or no work through no fault of their own. The great
English manufacture of the time was cloth, and crises in this trade
occurred both when Wolsey wanted to make war on the Netherlands
and when the merchants wished to prevent the exactions of
Charles I. We shall see that the misery of the inhabitants in the
English cloth-making districts had much to do with stimulating
the growth of an administrative system for poor relief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3) Rise
of prices affecting
food
earlier than
wages.</div>

<p>Later on in the sixteenth century, another cause tended to
increase the hardships of the poor, and so necessitated
new methods of poor relief. The influx
of silver from the New World caused a general rise
of prices. Food and clothing and rents rose more
quickly than wages, so that the poor could obtain fewer of the
necessaries of life<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>. The debasements of the English coinage,
by Henry VIII. in 1527, 1543, 1545 and 1546, and by Edward
VI. in 1551, still further increased this evil in England, and
during the transition the poorer classes must have been the
chief sufferers.</p>

<p>The effects following the break-up of the feudal system, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>increase of manufactures, and the rise of prices owing to the
influx of silver were in no way peculiar to England: they
account quite as much for the bands of vagrants on the
Continent as for those of this country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(4) In
England
sheep were
more profitable
than
corn.</div>

<p>But one cause of distress affected England more than the
other countries of Europe. It had become more
profitable to breed sheep than to plough the land,
and England was the great wool-producing country
of the world. Men, who had cultivated the soil,
were evicted in order that sheep-runs might be
formed, and thus agricultural labourers and small yeomen
helped to swell the crowds of the unemployed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Old
methods of
charity:</div>

<p>The existence therefore of the crowd of vagrants can be
accounted for by the social and economic changes of
the time, but it was none the less dangerous on that
account. The public authorities of state and town
began, early in the century, to make more frequent orders for
their repression, but it was soon clear that these orders could
not be effectual unless the relief of the poor were better
organised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1) Private
individuals.</div>

<p>For the most part charity was administered still either by
private individuals or ecclesiastical officials. We
can form some idea of the methods of private
donors from Harman's description of Elizabeth,
Countess of Shrewsbury, to whom he dedicates his book. In his
address to her he says, he knows well her "tender, pytyfull,
gentle and noble nature; not onelye havinge a vygelant and
mercifull eye to your poore, indygente and feable parishnores;
yea, not onely in the parishe where your honour moste happely
doth dwell, but also in others invyroninge or nighe adioyning to
the same; as also aboundantly powringe out dayely your ardent
and bountifull charytie upon all such as commeth for reliefe unto
your luckly gates." No wonder the writer thought it was his
"good necessary" and "bounden duty" to acquaint her with
the "abhominable wycked and detestable behavor" of some of
those rogues who "wyly wander, to the utter deludinge of the
good gevers, decevinge and impoverishinge of all such poore
householders, both sicke and sore, as neither can or maye walke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
abroad for reliefe and comfort, where, in dede, most mercy is to
be shewed<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>."</p>

<p>Stow tells us, that he had himself seen two hundred
people fed at Cromwell's gate, twice every day, with bread,
meat, and drink, "for he observed that ancient and charitable
custom, as all prelates, noblemen or men of honour and worship,
his predecessors had done before him<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>." This open-handed
hospitality thus seems to have been the custom of the time,
and if exercised, without discrimination and supervision, would
tend to foster the increase of idle beggars and do little to
lessen the hardships of the industrious poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) Monasteries.</div>

<p>The methods of distributing charity employed in the
monasteries were little better. It is true that the
services rendered by the monks and nuns to education
were considerable, and that a number of old
people and children were maintained in some of the religious
houses. Lodging also was given to wayfarers, and thus a very
useful function was fulfilled in countries where there were few
inns and no casual wards. But much of the relief given to the
poor by the monks seems to have been distributed in a similar
manner to that of the Countess of Shrewsbury. Alms were
given to the poor at the gates: many testators had left money
to be distributed in small doles at certain stated periods.
Moreover the relief given at different monasteries was not
coordinated in any way. The members of each institution gave
their alms in their own way without any reference to the gifts
of their neighbours. Besides, monks were not primarily intended
to be relieving officers, and were not placed where they
would be most useful for that purpose; there might be many
in one neighbourhood and few or none in another. The charity
distributed by the monks therefore was to a great extent
unorganised and indiscriminate and did nearly as much to
increase beggars as to relieve them<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">(3) Hospitals.</div>

<p>But besides the monasteries there were hospitals. The
term hospital was by no means confined to institutions
for relieving the sick, but almshouses,
orphanages and training homes were often called by this name.
St Thomas's Hospital may be taken as a typical institution of
the kind<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>. The date of its foundation is uncertain, but, early
in the thirteenth century, it was destroyed by fire, and in 1228
was rebuilt on much the same site as that occupied by the
St Thomas's Hospital of our own time. In 1323 the brethren
were ordered to follow the rule of St Augustine, that is they
were to take the vows of obedience and chastity, and to renounce
individual property. The hospital consisted of Master, brethren,
and sisters, and in the poet Gower's time there were also nurses,
for he left bequests to the Master, brethren, sisters, and nurses,
and asked from each their prayers. But, although the rule of
St Augustine and the prayers for the benefactors belonged
to the old order of things, the relief given to the poor was
essentially the same from the time of Henry III. to that of
Queen Victoria. It was founded for the relief and cure of poor
people, and in 1535 there were forty beds for the poor, and food
and firing were provided for them. Three years later it was
surrendered into the hands of Henry VIII., and under his
successor was reconstituted mainly on the old lines, but on a
very much larger scale.</p>

<p>There were however several drawbacks to the hospitals as
institutions for the relief of the poor. There was little security
that the funds were well administered or that the appointments
were impartially made. The king himself seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>have tried to exercise undue influence even in the case of
St Thomas's Hospital: in 1528 he pressed Wolsey to give the
Mastership to his chaplain, who, he said, was not learned enough
for the king. There were however worse abuses than this, and
even as early as the time of Henry V. it was necessary to pass
a statute to prevent the maladministration of hospital funds<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.
Moreover at best the hospitals were only isolated centres of
charity; they were not numerous enough to deal with poverty
as a whole, and they were not connected with each other. The
officials of each hospital acted on their own responsibility and
afforded much or little relief to the poor of their immediate
neighbourhood, but were almost as powerless as a private
individual to check the general evil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Attempts
at Reorganisation.</div>

<p>The charitable endowments of the Continent were as inefficient
as those of England, and both in England
and abroad we find that attempts were made to
organise a public system of poor relief in order that
the honest poor might be relieved, and the bands of vagrants
justly punished and repressed. Prof. Ashley has sketched the
early history of poor relief on the Continent. He shows that,
as early as 1522, the German towns of Augsburg and Nuremburg
endeavoured to regulate the administration of charity in order
to repress beggars, and that in 1525 the townsmen of Ypres
reorganised their charitable institutions on a general plan and
subjected the whole to public management with the approval
of the ecclesiastical authorities. This organisation of Ypres
was submitted to the judgment of the Sorbonne and, with some
limitations, the principles involved were approved<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. It is thus
clear that the necessity of reforming the administration of
charity was felt even in districts which were hostile to the
Reformation, and in countries where the Reformers were in
power the old charitable endowments were often seized by the
public authorities, who by so doing placed themselves under
greater obligations to provide for the poor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>In England we find that the course of events is similar.
The citizens of London, before 1518, began to draw up orders
with the object of repressing vagrants and controlling charity,
but after the dissolution of the monasteries they found it
necessary to refound and reorganise the greater part of the
existing system of relief. From that time until the reign of
Charles I. constant efforts were made to create and to administer
an efficient system of poor relief under public
management. In the reign of Charles I., and not until then,
were the efforts successful, and the English organisation is then
seen to be almost<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the only successful survivor of the many
schemes of the same kind which had been tried in Western
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. (a) Three
factors in the
making of
English poor
relief.</div>

<p>There were in England three principal factors in the
development of the system; first the orders of
the municipal governors, secondly the regulations
of Parliament, and lastly the efforts made by the
Privy Council to induce the justices of the peace
to put the law in execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. (b) Three
periods.</div>

<p>These three factors help to create the English system of
poor relief from the reign of Henry VIII. to that of
Charles I. But they are not of the same relative
importance throughout the whole period. Before
1569 the orders of the municipal governments are important,
between 1569 and 1597 the history of legislation is more
prominent, while after 1597 the orders directed by the Privy
Council to the justices become the most powerful force in
securing proper administration, and are therefore the predominant
factor in the development of the whole system.</p>

<p>We will consider each of these periods in turn and we shall
find that, while each contributed its share to the making of the
English system of poor relief, it was only during the last that
the success of the organisation was assured.</p>

<p>We have seen that the social changes of the beginning of
the sixteenth century led to a great increase in the number of
vagrants; and that men were then more ready to substitute
secular for ecclesiastical control in matters concerning the poor.
Town Council, Privy Council and Parliament all endeavour to
organise and supervise new methods of charity; and, by the
combined efforts of all three, a new system of poor relief was
gradually created. The earlier efforts in this direction were
made between 1514 and 1569; and Town Councils were then
more active than Parliament or Privy Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Importance
of
municipal
government in
Tudor times.</div>

<p>It is difficult now to realise the independent position of the
town governors of Tudor times, and the authority
possessed by them of regulating their own affairs.
They imposed taxes without the authority of Parliament;
uncontrolled, they could expel new comers
from their borders; and they were fertile in the device of new
punishments to drive the sturdy vagabond to honest labour.
Each town was a law unto itself. Some municipal rulers made
few experiments in this direction; others built hospitals for
the old, and training homes for the young; invented punishments
for the vagrants, and collected funds for the relief and
discipline of all who were unable to support themselves. Many
of the more successful orders, enforced in particular towns, were
afterwards embodied by Parliament in statutes applying to the
whole country. In the period from 1514 to 1569, the municipal
regulations concerning these matters suggest the provisions of
the statutes, more often than the provisions of the statutes
suggest the regulations of the towns. Between 1514 and 1569
we will therefore examine, first, the action taken by the municipal
authorities to improve and regulate the condition of sturdy
vagabonds, unemployed workmen, poor householders, impotent
beggars and neglected children: we will then consider the
efforts made by the Privy Council for the same ends and the
laws passed by Parliament with regard to the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>As London was, in these matters, more vigorous than other
towns, we will examine first in detail the orders adopted there,
and we will then see how far these regulations were typical of
those enforced in other places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">London.<br />
2. Regulations
for a
constant
supply of corn
in London,
1391-1569.</div>

<p>Some of the earliest of the London regulations for the help
of the poorer classes concern the supply of corn.
Even as early as the reign of Richard II., efforts
had been made by particular Lord Mayors to bring
corn to the City in years of famine. Adam Bamme,
Lord Mayor in 1391, "in a great dearth procured
corn from parts beyond the seas to be brought hither in such
abundance as sufficed to serve the city and the counties near
adjoining; to the furtherance of which good work he took out of
the orphans' chest in the Guildhall two thousand marks to buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the said corn, and each alderman laid out twenty pounds to the
like purpose<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>." But as London became more populous, the need
of a constant supply of grain became much more urgent. In
September 1520, therefore, an attempt was made to obtain the
necessary funds in a more regular manner.</p>

<p>The Common Council then resolved that "Forasmoch as
great derth and scarcity of whete hath nowe lately been and
more lyke tensue, yf good and politique provision were not
shortly made and hade Therfor in avoydyng therof, god
grauntyng, yt is nowe by auctorite of the Common Counsell
fully agreed and graunted that, in all goodly hast, oon thousand
pound of money shalbe levyed and payed by the felishippes of
sondry misteres and crafts of this citie, by way of a prest and
loone<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>." Each craft was to be assessed for an amount proportionate
to its wealth, and the wardens of each were left free
to levy the sum upon the craftsmen according to their discretion.
The funds so obtained were to be used to purchase
corn for the City; this was to be placed in a public granary and
used as a public store.</p>

<p>If only a small quantity of grain was brought into London
by the ordinary corn dealers, the buyers would bid against one
another until the price of corn became very great. There were
no rapid means of communication and, for a time therefore,
grain might be sold at famine prices and then as suddenly fall
in value. In future, whenever this seemed likely to happen, a
precept was to be issued by the Lord Mayor, ordering a certain
quantity of the public store to be brought into the market.
This supply would help to satisfy the more importunate buyers,
and so send down the price to something like the ordinary
level.</p>

<p>The public store of the City of London did not however
become a permanent institution until after 1520; on one
occasion the authorities misjudged the market and much of the
original loan was lost, after which there was some difficulty in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>persuading the Companies to again advance the necessary
capital. However, from this time onwards, corn was generally
bought for the Companies' granaries whenever especial scarcity
was feared, and during the reign of Elizabeth the Companies'
store became a regular institution.</p>

<p>So far as the arrangements made in 1520 are concerned, the
poor do not appear to have obtained corn at a reduced price,
but they were the greatest sufferers when the price of corn was
high, and regulations which had the effect of lessening the price
benefited them more than the other inhabitants of London and
were made chiefly in their interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Regulations
adopted in
London for
the repression
of vagrants
and
relief of the
impotent
poor, 1514-1518.</div>

<p>A series of regulations was adopted in London, between 1514
and 1524, which more directly concerns vagrants
and beggars. These regulations are at first negative
rather than positive; they forbid able-bodied
vagrants to beg and they forbid the citizens to give
to unlicensed beggars. Public disgrace formed part
of the punishment of offending vagrants. Vagabonds
were to have the letter V. fastened upon
their breasts and were to be "dryven throughoute all Chepe
with a basone rynging afore them<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>." Four surveyors were appointed
to carry out these instructions. They were apparently
dressed as grand City officials, for the Chamberlain paid the
Lord Mayor for their sock hosen "embrodred<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>." Another
special officer was admitted to the office of "Master and cheff
avoyder and Keeper owte of this Citie and the liberties of the
same of all the myghty vagabunds and beggars, and all other
suspecte persons, excepte all such as were uppon thym the
badge of this City<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>." In 1524, moreover, a great search was
made, and it was ordered, that the vagabonds "myghty of
body" should be "tayed at a cart's tayle" and "be beten by the
Shireff's offycers with whippes in dyuers places of the Citie."
The Chamberlain, also, "shall cause rownde colers of iron to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>made for every of them, havyng the armes of this Citie uppon
them and the same colers to be putt aboute theyr nekks<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>."</p>

<p>Meanwhile other orders of the Court of Aldermen concern
the impotent and aged poor, and at first the City rulers did not
become responsible for the collection of funds, but only for
distinguishing between the really disabled beggars and impostors.
Tokens of pure white tin were provided, which the
Aldermen were to give to the impotent poor: all other beggars
were strictly prohibited<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. These efforts do not differ in principle
from those of former times, but the orders are more frequent,
and the appointment of surveyors and officers indicates that
they were better enforced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Collection
of alms under
authority of
Aldermen of
London.</div>

<p>Very soon it was seen that this was not enough, because,
even if the disabled beggars were licensed, they
were not always sufficiently relieved. In 1533,
therefore, the Aldermen were ordered to depute
persons to gather "the devotions of parishioners
for the poor folk weekly and to distribute them to the poor folk
at the church doors<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>." Thus the municipality began to make
itself responsible for the collection of funds but, at the same
time, the system of licensed beggars was continued, and more
brooches were made for the Aldermen to distribute to such
impotent beggars as they allowed.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, the authorities of London had taken
measures to limit relief to the deserving poor, but they had not
attempted much organisation of funds, or attempted to forbid
beggars altogether.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Refoundation
of
St Bartholomew's
Hospital
and
imposition of
compulsory
poor rates in
London,
1536-1547.</div>

<p>But the dissolution of the monasteries made the relief
of the poor by public authority a much more urgent
matter. Stow gives a list of 15 hospitals and
four lazar houses which existed within the City
walls in 1536<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. Eight of these were in danger, including
some of the richest and largest foundations.
St Mary's Spittle provided 180 beds for the poor, while
St Thomas's and St Bartholomew's each maintained places
for 40 patients. In 1538, therefore, the City authorities made
an effort to save these hospitals. The mayor, Sir Richard
Gresham, the aldermen and the commonalty of the City of
London, presented a petition to Henry VIII., and asked that
these three foundations and the new Abbey on Tower Hill
might be preserved, "so that all impotent persones, not hable
to labor shalbe releved by reason of the sayd hospitalls &amp;
abbey, and all sturdy beggers not wylling to lab<sup>r</sup> shalbe
punisshed, so that w<sup>t</sup> Godd's grace fewe or no persones shalbe
seene abrode to begge or aske almesse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a><br /><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same petition they also ask that the king will give
to the mayor and commonalty the four great churches of the
Grey, White, Black and Augustinian Friars because they state
that the remaining churches "suffyce not to receyve all the
people comyng to the sayd parysshe churches" and the sick
crowd in with the healthy to the "great noysance" of the inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>."</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June, 1544, the king, to some slight extent,
acceded to their requests and refounded St Bartholomew's
Hospital. He agreed to furnish an endowment of 500 marks
a year if the Common Council would do the same<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. In 1546
the Common Council therefore bound themselves to do so, and
in December an indenture was drawn up between the City and
the king. The king granted not only St Bartholomew's but
also Bethlehem Hospital, besides the Church of the Grey
Friars, which was henceforward named Christ Church, and the
parish church of St Nicholas. The City agreed to provide
100 beds in St Bartholomew's, which for a time was called
the House of the Poor in Smithfield<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. In 1547 the king confirmed
his grant by Letters Patent<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>

<p>But the citizens were at this time very little disposed to
give to the poor. Latimer<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, Lever, and Brinklow all complain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>of their want of generosity, and the reasons given for the
imposition of the first compulsory poor rate show that the
complaints were well founded. Collections were made in the
London parish churches every Sunday, but the sum raised was
not sufficient to support the poor of even one hospital. In
1547 (1 Edward VI.), therefore, the Common Council resolved
that the Sunday collections should cease and that instead "the
citizens and inhabitants of the said Citie shall further contrybute
&amp; paye towards the sustentacon &amp; maynteyning &amp;
fynding of the said poore personages the moitie or half deale
of one whole fiftene<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>." This is probably the first time a compulsory
tax was levied for the relief of the poor; the assessment
is ordered by the London Common Council a quarter of a
century before Parliament had given authority for the making
of assessments for this object.</p>

<p>The half-fifteenth was to support the poor in the hospital
for a year; after that time other methods of raising funds were
employed. In 1548, certain profits belonging to the City were
assigned to the fund for the relief of the poor, and, in addition,
the sum of 500 marks, promised by the Common Council, was
assessed upon the different City Companies according to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>importance. The chief companies seemed to have paid willingly,
but some of the smaller companies objected, and the wardens
were ordered in consequence to appear before the Court of
Aldermen and bring their money<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. On this occasion the
companies yielded and the money was paid, but the incident
shows that, as yet, the citizens were by no means eager to
undertake the duty of looking after the poor.</p>

<p>The provision for them had been altogether inadequate.
"I thinke in my judgement," writes Brinklow in 1545, "under
heaven is not so lytle provision made for the pore as in London,
of so ryche a Citie<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>." The foundation of St Bartholomew's was
not sufficient: in 1550, Lever, preaching before the king, reiterates
the complaints of Brinklow. "Nowe speakynge in the
behalfe of these vile beggars, ... I wyl tell the(e) that art a
noble man, a worshipful man, an honest welthye man, especially
if thou be Maire, Sherif, Alderman, baily, constable or any such
officer, it is to thy great shame afore the worlde, and to thy
utter damnation afore God, to se these begging as thei use to
do in the streates. For there is never a one of these, but he
lacketh eyther thy charitable almes to relieve his neede, orels
thy due correction to punysh his faute.... These sely sols
have been neglected throghout al England and especially in
London and Westminster: But now I trust that a good overseer,
a godly Byshop I meane, wyl see that they in these two
cyties, shall have their neede releeved, and their faultes
corrected, to the good ensample of al other tounes and
cities<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>."</p>

<p>Brinklow and Lever both throw the responsibility for the
disorder upon the citizens and the municipal officers, as if they
were then recognised to be the chief authorities for dealing
with the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Completion
of the
Four Royal
Hospitals
and establishment
of
a municipal
system of
poor relief in
London.</div>

<p>Ridley was the "good overseer," who was to amend these
faults. In April 1550 he was appointed Bishop
of London and, during the next three years, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>endeavoured to place the relief of the poor on a sound
basis. The Lord Mayors of 1551 and 1552, Sir
Richard Dobbs and Sir George Barnes, also took
the matter up warmly and, in consequence, a municipal
system was organised and the three royal hospitals of King
Edward's foundation were established.</p>

<p>Negotiations were soon undertaken with regard to St
Thomas's Hospital: the citizens wished to obtain the lands of
the hospital for the relief of the poor. In February 1552 some
of their number were appointed to "travaile" with the king
for this purpose, and it was finally agreed that the citizens
should pay £2461. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for property worth about £160 a
year, while the king should grant an endowment in addition
of about an equal amount. Thus St Thomas's Hospital was
refounded under municipal management<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time it was reported that St Bartholomew's
Hospital had fallen into decay; the buildings were therefore
repaired and the endowments increased. Christ's Hospital, the
present Blue Coat School, was also founded for fatherless
children, on the land of the Grey Friars formerly granted by
Henry VIII. In order to raise the necessary funds the inhabitants
of London were called to their parish churches and there
were addressed in eloquent orations from the Lord Mayor, Sir
Richard Dobbs, and the Aldermen and other "grave citizens."
They were told how much better it would be to take the
beggars from the streets and provide for them in hospitals, and
were asked how much they would contribute weekly towards
their relief. Books were drawn up of the sums promised and
delivered by the Mayor to the King's Commissioners, in order
that the king might do his part, and the whole be placed
upon a satisfactory basis<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. At the same time Ridley had
endeavoured to help the citizens to obtain the royal palace of
Bridewell, in order that a new kind of hospital might be
founded, not for the impotent, but for the training, correction
and relief of the able-bodied. He tried to interest Cecil in his
object, and his letter to him is a curious specimen of the style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>of a charity letter of the time. "Good Mr Cecil," he writes,
"I must be a suitor unto you in our good Master Christ's
cause; I beseech you be good to him. The matter is, Sir,
alas! he hath lain too long abroad (as you do know) without
lodging, in the streets of London, both hungry, naked and cold.
Now, thanks be to Almighty God! the citizens are willing to
refresh him, and to give him both meat, drink, cloathing and
firing: but alas! Sir, they lack lodging for him. For in some
one house, I dare say, they are fain to lodge three families
under one roof. Sir, there is a wide, large, empty house of the
King's Majesty's, called Bridewell, that would wonderfully well
serve to lodge Christ in, if he might find such good friends in
the court to procure in his cause.... Sir, I have promised my
brethren the citizens to move you, because I do take you for
one that feareth God, and would that Christ should lie no more
abroad in the streets<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>."</p>

<p>In a sermon preached by him before Edward in 1552 Ridley
spoke much of the duties and responsibilities of those in high
places towards the weaker classes. After the sermon we are
told that the king sent for the Bishop and asked him what
were the measures that he wished undertaken for the help of
the London poor. Ridley asked leave to confer with the Lord
Mayor and citizens of London, and, by them in the same year,
a petition was presented to the Privy Council, showing the
manner in which they hoped to proceed.</p>

<p>This petition stated that amongst the poor of the City the
citizens espied three sorts; the "succourless poor child," the
"sick and impotent," and the "sturdy vagabond." Christ's
Hospital was now ready for the first, and some provision had
been made for the second. With regard to the third class, that
of sturdy vagabonds or idle persons, they considered "that the
greatest number of beggars, fallen into misery by lewd and
evil service, by wars, by sickness or other adverse fortune, have
so utterly lost their credit, that though they would show themselves
willing to labour, yet are they so suspected and feared
of all men, that few or none dare or will receive them to work:
wherefore we saw that there could be no means to amend this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>miserable sort, but by making some general provision of work,
wherewith the willing poor may be exercised; and whereby the
froward, strong and sturdy vagabond may be compelled to live
profitably to the Commonwealth<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>." The poor to whom the
citizens here refer are beggars; the poor householders who
remained at home are not considered. Moreover in describing
the sturdy vagabonds the word beggars is used, thus showing
that it was the mendicant class of whom the citizens were
thinking, and that they so far had little conception of distinguishing
between the beggars and other poor. The citizens go
on to say, that the classes of sturdy beggars they have in their
mind are "the child unapt to learning," "the sore and sick
when they be cured," and "such prisoners as are quit at the
sessions." The general provision of work was to be furnished
by a hospital, and it is carefully stated that the occupations
there were to be "profitable to all the King's Majesty's
subjects and hurtful to none." It is interesting to notice how
it is proposed to get over the difficulty of pauper-made goods
so far as the merchants were concerned. Certain citizens in
the trade were to give out the raw material to the unemployed
in the hospital. When they were wrought up, they were to
receive back the finished goods and pay the hospital for their
labour, while the stock of raw material was to be renewed.
The manufactured goods would thus be put upon the market
by the merchants with the rest of their stock and not in competition
with them. They propose to exercise such trades as
the making of caps and of feather-bed ticks and the drawing of
wire. The "weaker sort" were to be employed in carding,
knitting, and the dyeing of silk; the "fouler sort" in the
making of nails and iron work.</p>

<p>Apparently the king and the Privy Council were satisfied
with the plans of the City authorities, for an indenture was
drawn up between the king and the citizens which was afterwards
confirmed by the Royal Letters Patent<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Not only
were the earlier grants concerning St Thomas's and Christ's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>confirmed, but the palace of Bridewell also was given to the City,
in order that provision might be made for the relief, employment
and discipline of sturdy beggars. Bridewell was not however
immediately established but there is a report concerning
St Bartholomew's in 1552, and Christ's and St Thomas's in
1553, which show that these three then were doing a considerable
work. The pamphlet concerning St Bartholomew's was
drawn up because there had been complaints concerning the
expenditure and the partial failure of the work there<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. The
authorities state that the place was in a very dilapidated condition
when it was received from the king, but that now, in 1552,
one hundred beds were fully maintained; during the last five
years on an average eight hundred persons had been healed,
while one hundred and seventy-two had died. The regular
expenses amounted to nearly eight hundred pounds a year and
the regular income contributed by City and king reached the
sum of £666. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> The extra expenditure and the deficit
were contributed "by the charitie of certeine merciful citizens."
The "biddell" of the hospital was especially charged to see
that there was no abuse of its charity. If any person, that had
been there cured, should counterfeit any "griefe or disease" or
beg within the City, the beadle was to "committ him to some
cage." Thus in 1552 the work of St Bartholomew's had been
settled on a satisfactory basis. In 1553 reports were also
drawn up of Christ's Hospital and St Thomas's<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. Christ's then
contained two hundred and eighty children<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, while another
hundred were boarded in the country. More extensive powers
seem to have been exercised at St Thomas's Hospital than
at the other Royal hospitals, possibly because all the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>hospitals dealt more especially with the poor in the City and
it was therefore more convenient to separate their functions.
St Thomas's was situated apart in Southwark and its governors
exercised more general powers. Not only did the hospital
relieve two hundred and sixty "aged, sore and sick persons"
but it also pensioned five hundred other poor who lived in their
homes: moreover in 1562 "yt is Agred uppon that A place
shalbe appoynted to ponysh the sturdy and transegressors<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>."
The annual expenses of Christ's and St Thomas's in 1553
together amounted to £3240. 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, and of this sum £2914
was given by "free alms of the Citizens of London." Considering
the value of money in those days and the probable
number of the inhabitants, this was a very large amount. The
liberality of the citizens was not always however stimulated by
such bishops as Bishop Ridley, or such Lord Mayors as Sir
Richard Dobbs, Sir Martin Bowes, and Sir George Barnes.
In the reign of Elizabeth St Thomas's was in debt and the
number maintained there had to be considerably reduced.
Before 1557 Bridewell also was established and thus the
number of the four Royal hospitals was completed. The
hospital of Bethlehem was included in the original grant of
Henry VIII. and probably had a continuous existence. It was
a comparatively small institution, in which fifty or sixty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>lunatics were maintained, and in later times was always
reckoned with Bridewell, so that it also formed part of the
system of Royal hospitals under the management of the City
although it was not counted as a separate hospital. In 1557
orders were drawn up for the government of the hospitals<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>, and
we can see that their erection had already made it more
possible to distinguish between the different classes in need of
relief. The City rulers do not now as in 1552 consider the
word "beggars" interchangeable with the word "poor" but
explain that "there is as great a difference between a poor
man and a beggar, as is between a true man and a thief." ...
"The policy of the erection of hospitals ..." they say "hath had
good success and taken effect; for there is no poor citizen at
this day that beggeth his bread but by some mean his poverty
is provided for." The objects of the organisation are also
explained to include the yielding "alms to the poor and honest
householder<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>."</p>

<p>The hospitals are said to be linked together in their government,
the objects of all are said to be the same; although to
each hospital some governors were especially appointed, all
had authority and responsibility with regard to the whole four<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

<p>The London Bridewell was destined to be the forerunner of
so many Bridewells or Houses of Correction that it is perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>interesting to examine more closely the rules for its management.
Any two of its governors had power to take into the
house persons presented to them as "lewd and idle." They had
also power to search all places in which masterless men were
likely to be found, and to punish landlords or tenants who
harboured them.</p>

<p>The governors of the whole establishment were subdivided
so that some might overlook every department. The rules
with regard to the cloth-making establishment will illustrate
the kind of supervision they were to exercise. They were first
to make an inventory of the raw material and of the looms
and other necessary implements. They were then to see that
the clothier knew his business, and to order him to return a
monthly account of the number of cloths which had been
wrought. They were, moreover, to overlook the wool house,
yarn house and spinning house and "to comptroll and rebuke"
as they "shall see cause." They were to pay the workpeople,
the weavers for weaving, the fullers for thicking and the
spinners for spinning. The steward was to be allowed to
charge for the diet of those that were employed. Every week
they were to make a summary of their doings and every month
a summary of their accounts.</p>

<p>Other crafts were supervised in the same manner; the nail
house was in close connection with the Company of Ironmongers,
probably in order to carry out the undertaking that
the occupations "should be profitable to all the King's subjects
and hurtful to none." The Ironmongers were to give "to this
house, as the people of the same may reasonably live"; they
were to have the preference with regard to the sale of the
manufactured goods and to be allowed a month in which to
make payment.</p>

<p>The worst vagrants were apparently sent to the mill and
the bakehouse, but men who were fit for better employment
were not to stay there. If the governors, we are told, shall
"find any there above the ordinary, then shall ye cause the
same to be known to the clerk of the work and see he bestow
them in some other exercise."</p>

<p>Bridewell does not seem to have effectually reformed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
vagrants, for the governors were to "see to the good order of
the said mills, that neither the vagabonds do use shameless
craving nor begging to the great grief of good men and slander
of the house, neither that they obstinately and frowardly shall
deny their aid and help towards the lifting up and taking down
of such grain as shall be brought into the said mill<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>."</p>

<p>Bridewell, we have seen, was founded for the unemployed,
but it is obvious from the language used that the citizens had
mainly in their minds beggars who were unemployed, and from
the first it seems rather to have been used for confirmed
vagrants and untrained children than for labourers out of
work. The governors certainly held regular meetings, about
once a fortnight, and discussed the various cases that came
before them. These nearly all concern petty offenders, thieves
or vagrants, but there are one or two cases in which a man is
admitted because "the City is charged to find him<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>." Other
entries relate to young people who were apprenticed to the
House and properly trained to work at some trade. In the
later years of the century about two thousand persons passed
through the hospital annually. Bridewell was the last of
the Royal Hospitals to be established after 1557. Some provision
was made for every class of the London poor. The
municipal system of relief had begun with the punishment of
vagrants; it proceeded to license all beggars entitled to ask for
relief, and finally all the poor were nominally provided for and
the funds were raised by compulsory taxation.</p>

<p>There was no sudden break with the older system.
St Thomas's, St Bartholomew's and Bedlam had all been
hospitals for centuries. They had been saved from destruction,
improved and enlarged, but essentially the same work was
done in the same places. There were however important
points of difference between the new system and the old even
as regards these three hospitals. They were under public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>management. There were many abuses in this management,
but these abuses were now more readily detected and punished
and were found out and reformed several times in the course of
the next century.</p>

<p>But a more important difference lay in the fact that the
hospitals were not now isolated institutions, each dealing with
their patients, but were now part of a larger whole and had a
definite part to play in the government of the City. Vagrants,
who were taken to Bridewell and found to be ill, were sent on
to St Bartholomew's or St Thomas's, while, on the other hand,
a whipping was administered to the idlers after cure at
St Thomas's, and the beadle of St Bartholomew's had special
orders to prevent discharged inmates from begging. All these
regulations show that they had become, not merely agencies
for the relief of the sick, but also part of a system which aimed
at the repression of beggars.</p>

<p>Bridewell was the greatest innovation and the most
characteristic institution of the new system. The organisation
for the relief of the poor had been called into existence because
the crowds of vagrants were a chronic nuisance and danger to
society. Bridewell dealt with the most difficult class of these
vagrants and gave some of them a chance of training and
reform. Moreover, Bridewell as a place of punishment for
idlers was the necessary counterpart of the new schemes for
universal relief. You could not relieve and find work for every
one unless you had some means for coercing and punishing the
"sturdy vagabond." Christ's Hospital, like Bridewell, is a new
institution, but, unlike Bridewell, it does not altogether strike
out a new line. Still, as soon as the relief of the poor becomes
a public duty, institutions for the training of the young become
increasingly popular, and we shall find that, during the next
century, there are other Christ's Hospitals as well as other
Bridewells in most of the great towns of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Failure
of the municipal
system
in London.</div>

<p>This municipal system however was not successful in
London. So far as London was concerned the
organisation seemed fairly complete. But even
from the local point of view the system was weak
in one point. Funds had to be provided. It was not easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
suddenly to raise the money necessary for the new organisation;
men were not accustomed to be taxed for the poor, and, as soon
as the first enthusiasm had subsided, a sufficient sum could not
be collected. During the succeeding period we shall find that
the rulers of London found great difficulty in this matter, and
that this was one of the causes of the want of success of the
municipal system of London. But another difficulty was inherent
in the system in the very fact that it was municipal,
and not national. A few years ago the distribution of the
Mansion House Relief Fund caused a considerable immigration
from the country. Exactly the same result arose from the first
organisation of the poor in the City of London. In March,
1568/9, we are told that "forasmuch as experience late hath
shewed that the charitable relief gyuen as well by the quenes
ma<sup>ties</sup> most noble progenitors as also the charitable almes from
tyme to tyme collected within this citie and bestowed by the
cittizens, aswell upon the poore and nedy citizens, being sicke,
impotent and lambe as the poore orphans and fatherless
children ... aswell in Chryste Church and Bridwell as in other
hospitalles founded for the reliefe of the poore within the said
citie, hath drawen into this citie great nombers of vagabondes,
roges, masterless men and Idle persons as also poore, lame and
sick persons dwellyng in the most partes of the realme<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>." The
very measures which were taken to cope with poverty in
London thus increased the crowd of beggars, not because they
caused more people to become beggars, but because they
attracted the poor from all parts. The City organisation broke
down because it was confined to the City, but it had already
done considerable service in helping the growth of the national
organisation which was to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poor relief in towns other than London.</div>
<div class="sidenote">7. Provision of corn in Bristol and Canterbury.</div>

<p>We have now to examine a few cases in which other towns
before 1569 adopted measures similar to those of
London. With regard to the provision of corn it
is quite possible that the London plan was widely
followed. In 1522 we read that in Bristol "this
yere whete, corn, and other graynes rose at a dire
price, by reason whereof the said Maire, of his gode disposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>inclyning his charitie towardes the comen wele and profite of
this Towne," ordered grain to be bought in Worcester, "by
reason wherof greate abundance of whete, corn, and other
graynes was so provided, that the inhabitauntes of the said
towne were greatly releved and comforted in mynysshing of the
price of whete, corn and other graynys, sold in the open markett
of this said Towne<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>." At Canterbury the funds for this purpose
are accounted for in the year 1552. More than £70 was then
spent in the purchase of wheat and barley. It was not however
altogether raised by the Town Council, more than half was
obtained from the sale of the plate of the parish of St Andrew
and from contributions from the parishes of St George and
St Michael. This corn was bought especially for the benefit
of the poor, and about one-fifth part of it was directly sold to
them; the rest was sold to large buyers, and could only have
benefited the poor by easing the market and so lowering the
price to everybody<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. Survey
and employment
of poor
at Lincoln.</div>

<p>The surveying and licensing of beggars appears to have
been very usual. Thus, at Lincoln in 1543, the
constables were ordered to bring all the poor
people in the city before the justices and it was
provided that those who were to be allowed to beg should have
a sign given to them. A similar order was made in 1546, and
it was also decided that no one was to give alms to any beggar
without a sign<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. These orders are exactly parallel to the
earlier measures of the rulers of London. Next year, in 1547,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the citizens of Lincoln took a farther step. Not only were the
beggars to be surveyed, but they were to be set to work, and in
1551 all the young people, who lived idly, were placed with the
clothiers for eight or nine years and were to have meat, drink
and other necessaries. All who refused this work were to be
expelled from the town<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. In 1560 a salary is paid to an officer
who is to oversee and order all the poor and idle people in the
town<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. Special collections for the relief of the poor were also
made in Lincoln before 1569, but apparently only in times of
plague<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. Grants were occasionally made to particular poor at
other times and there was a more than usually definite amount
of relief provided by the guild regulations for the poorer
members of some of the Lincoln guilds<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

Christ's
Hospital.</div>

<p>But the measures of Ipswich resemble those of London
more closely even than those of Lincoln. There the
poor were not only surveyed and licensed, but before
1569 compulsory taxation was adopted and a municipal
hospital was erected. As early as 1469 the
burgesses had granted certain dues to lepers, but it
was not until about 1551 that the municipal rulers
began to make frequent and regular orders for the regulation of
relief and beggary. In that year two persons were nominated
by the bailiffs, "to enquire into the poore of every parish, and
thereof to make certifficate to the Bayliffs<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>." Next year we
find the burgesses anxious to increase the voluntary alms. The
order of the guild festival was arranged, and it was agreed that
the town officers should attend in their robes, and "they and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>the Burgesses shall offer, and the offerings shall goe to the
poore<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>."</p>

<p>In 1556 eight burgesses were appointed to frame measures
"for the ordering of the maintenance of the poore and impotent
people, ffor providing them work, ffor suppressing of vagrants
and idle persons<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>."</p>

<p>We also find an attempt to decrease the number of beggars
in an order worthy of an Irish town: "Noe children of this
towne shall be p'mitted to begg, and suche as shall be admitted
thereto shall have badges<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>."</p>

<p>A further step was then taken, and in Ipswich, as in London,
compulsory payments were made for the poor. In 1557 it is
ordered that "if any inhabitant shall refuse to pay suche
money as shall be allotted him to pay for the use of the poore,"
he shall be punished at the discretion of the bailiffs<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, in 1569, we find the town hospital established.
Christ's Hospital in Ipswich was built on the site of the House
of the Black Friars and was a house of correction, as well as an
asylum for the old and a training school for the young<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. It was
apparently no disgrace for the old to be admitted, for when it
was provided that ships should pay certain dues to the hospital,
it was also agreed that every mariner, who had lived in the
town three years and should stand in need of assistance, should
be allowed to go there<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. At Ipswich therefore, in 1569, beggars
were badged, the poor were organised, compulsory payments
were exacted and a town hospital had been founded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10. Survey
of poor and
regular
assessment
of parishioners
in Cambridge.</div>

<p>At Cambridge also similar measures were taken. Some of
the profits arising from Stourbridge fair had been
left to the poor of Cambridge and was connected
with a provision for the maintenance of "obiits."
The funds belonging to the poor were preserved to
them by the statute of chantries, but before 1552
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>it had not been paid. Complaint was then made, and it was
decreed that the sum should be paid to the mayor, bailiffs, and
burgesses, and should be distributed by them as in ancient
times: this order was confirmed by royal grant in 1557<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>."</p>

<p>It is possible that the passing of this money through their
hands may have made the town authorities regard the care of
the poor as especially their duty.</p>

<p>In any case, in 1556, there was great scarcity and, on
Dec. 7th, "Dr Perne, Vice-chancellor, Doctors Segewycke,
Harvy, Walker and Blythe met the Mayor, Bailiffs and two
Aldermen in St Mary's Church<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>." They called before them
the churchwardens of all the parisshes, and these "browght in
the bylls what any parryshoner was cessed towardes the relyeffe
of the poore." Two days later the churchwardens presented
"bylles of the number of poore people in the parisshes," and they
were told to make a report as to "three states of the poore
sort" and to inquire who had come into the parish within
three years. Later, four superintendents and four "watchers
for straunge beggeres" were appointed, and collectors were
chosen for the next Sunday. The Vice-chancellor moved the
Heads of Houses to make provision for the poor, and the superintendents
went about the different parishes and visited the
poor and settled what each should receive. On December 24th
the Mayor and Vice-chancellor met at St Mary's to again settle
what each poor person should be given and to give greater
sums to some of them than had been before appointed<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1560 a set of ordinances was made for the purpose of
raising funds to pay these pensions. Dues were to be paid for
admission into the liberties of the town, for beginning actions
in the Cambridge Law Courts, for the admission of attorneys
to plead, for the surrendering of every booth and the signing of
every lease. All these were to augment the funds for the poor.
The attorneys were also to pay 1<i>d.</i> for every fee<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus in Cambridge also we have, first, the surveying and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>numbering of the poor; then, regular contributions from the
parishioners, and regular payments to the poor who could not
support themselves. At Cambridge there was no town hospital
before 1569, and it was not until 1578 that a proposal to
establish one there was made.</p>

<p>But attempts were already being made to found municipal
hospitals in Norwich and Gloucester, and these we shall examine
when we consider the events of the period between 1569 and
1597. Moreover, three of the old hospitals of York were refounded
and placed under municipal management<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. There the
poor could be "set on worke" and the income derived from them
was to be "ymployed to the maintenance of the powre." At
Leicester also a municipal system for the poor had developed,
and it seems that, in 1568, two collections were levied for this
purpose, one of which provided the funds necessary for the
relief distributed under the authority of the statutes, and
the other met the expenditure incurred under the municipal
regulations<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus in Lincoln, Ipswich, Cambridge, and York the order of
development in matters concerning beggars and the unemployed
is similar to that of London. Beggars are surveyed; the truly
helpless are licensed; the others are forbidden to ask for any
relief. Compulsory rates for their relief were levied in Ipswich
and probably in Cambridge. At the same time provision is
made for finding the able-bodied work in Lincoln, and hospitals
are built or refounded for them in Ipswich, in York, and in
Gloucester.</p>

<p>In Ipswich as in London all this was done before 1569, but
other towns were much more backward, and in some the beggars
were still unrestrained. There was thus no national system of
poor relief, but only isolated municipal attempts to deal with
the matter, all following the same general lines and becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>the rule, and not the exception, as time went on. It will be
more convenient to consider the advantages of this system
when we have also examined the doings of Parliament and
Privy Council, and can consider the organisation before 1569 as
a whole. The municipal system alone was not successful, in
London or elsewhere; it was increasingly difficult to deal with
new-comers and to provide funds.</p>

<p>But already before 1569 there were the beginnings of the
succeeding national system in the doings of Parliament and
Privy Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Efforts
made by the
Government
to secure the
employment
of the clothworkers
during the
crisis in the
cloth trade of
1527-8.</div>

<p>The Privy Council interfered comparatively little on behalf
of the poor in this earliest period of the development
of the English system of poor relief. However, in
1528 and on several other occasions the Government
issued orders similar to those afterwards
issued by the authority of the Privy Council. In
1528, however, these orders are said to come from
Wolsey or the king, and it only incidentally appears
that the Council had also a part in the matter. Possibly the
policy, thus initiated, was the creation of Wolsey or of the
Duke of Norfolk, but it was precisely the same kind of policy
as that afterwards carried out under the authority of the Privy
Council during the reigns of Elizabeth, James, and Charles.</p>

<p>The latter part of the year 1527 and the spring of 1528 was
a time of great discontent and disorder. At the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the year 1528 England had allied herself with France against the
Emperor, and thus the ordinary trade in cloth to the Flemish
markets was interrupted, and the Staple was moved to Calais.
The English cloth-making industry was already carried on for
foreign markets on a fairly large scale. In certain districts the
greater number of inhabitants were employed by clothiers, who
sold the manufactured cloths to the merchants chiefly for
Flemish markets. The declaration of war therefore prevented
the usual sale of cloths; consequently when the manufacturers
in accordance with the trade regulations then in force brought
the cloths to Blackwell Hall, the merchants did not buy as
usual and the clothiers ceased to find work for their men. The
workers had few other resources and disturbances followed.
The Duke of Norfolk was sent into Suffolk to restore order,
and persuaded the clothiers to keep their men in employment.
He called representative employers before him from every town
and told them that the reports concerning the detention of
English merchants in Flanders were untrue. "If I had not
quenched that bruit," he writes to Wolsey, "I should have
had two or three hundred women sueing to me to make the
clothiers set their husbands and children to work<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>." The same
course was followed in other districts; Lord Sandys writes to
Wolsey that he has received letters from both Wolsey and the
King, which order him to see that the workpeople are not
dismissed. He says nothing of the kind shall occur in Hants.,
and he hopes that Berks. and Wilts. will be equally well
managed<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. In Kent Sir Henry Guildford obtained a promise
that no men should be sent away before harvest<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>. Both Norfolk
and Guildford state however that the clothiers cannot hold out
much longer, and they ask Wolsey to remedy this by persuading
the merchants to buy the unsold cloths in the clothiers'
hands<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. When the king's Council heard of the difficulty, we
are told that the Cardinal sent for a great number of merchants,
and thus addressed them. "Sirs, the King is informed that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>use not yourselves like merchants, but like graziers and
artificers; for when the clothiers do daily bring cloths to your
market for your ease, to their great cost, and there be ready to
sell them, you of your wilfulness will not buy them, as you
have been accustomed to do. What manner of men be you?"
said the Cardinal, "I tell you, that the King straitly commandeth
you to buy their cloths, as before time you have been
accustomed to do, upon pain of his high displeasure<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>." The
Cardinal further threatened to throw open the cloth trade
to foreigners if the English merchants refused to buy as
usual.</p>

<p>This remedy might be a clumsy one but it was not ineffectual.
The cloth trade, in this instance, was restored to its
usual course by the conclusion of a truce between England and
the Netherlands. The time during which the contraction of
the market occurred was short, and the clothiers could and did
lessen the evils of this temporary fluctuation in their trade by
continuing to find work and purchase cloths, as in more prosperous
times, even though it was to their private disadvantage.
A course of this kind was dangerous if the trade was permanently
affected, but possible and useful under the actual circumstances,
and probably saved the country from serious disturbance. The
incident illustrates the fact that the difficulty of the relief of
the poor was increased by the growth of manufactures on a
large scale, because employment was more unstable, and because
all the members of a family and most of the inhabitants of a
neighbourhood were often out of work at the same time. Under
these circumstances the distress of the poor was immediately
followed by riots<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>, and the action of Wolsey and the Council was
occasioned, not only by the sufferings of the poor, but also by
danger to the public peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Regulations
for
the supply of
the markets
with corn,
1527-8.</div>

<p>The connection between the distress of the poor and public
order is also evident in the corn measures of 1527-8.
The harvest of 1527 failed, while in the same year
the coinage was debased, so that the average price
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>of wheat was nearly double that of preceding years<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>. Part
of this rise was thought to be due to the unfair buying of
some of the corn-dealers. A commission was issued setting
forth that owing to forestalling, regrating and engrossing "more
scarcity of corn is pretended to be within this our said realm
than, God be thanked, there is in very truth<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>." The commissioners
were therefore to punish all offenders in this respect,
and were also to find out by inquiry how great the supply of
corn really was and to see that it was brought to market when
needed<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>. Some of the reports drawn up in accordance with
these instructions are in existence, and give for particular places
the price and quantity of different kinds of grain and the
number of inhabitants in the district<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. In Essex and Suffolk
the commissioners also talked to the more wealthy people and
urged them to buy a store of corn for the poor. It was only
however in Colchester and Bergholt that they seemed at all
willing to do so<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. On the whole there were few efforts at direct
relief of the poor; the object of the Council was to obtain
information and to prevent any aggravation of the scarcity by
unfair practices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time measures were undertaken to lessen the
disorder from which the country was suffering. In December
1527 a great search was made for vagrants, and the commissioners
report the punishment of valiant beggars<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. Notwithstanding
all this there was a serious disturbance in Kent.
The people asked for the return of the loan raised two years
before, because they were so sore impoverished by the great
dearth of corn<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. The harvest of 1528 however was fortunately
fairly plentiful, and the country again became peaceful. These
difficulties again illustrate the connection between poverty and
disorder, and show that the Privy Council first came to interfere
in these matters in order to maintain the peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Similar
action with
regard to
corn in 1548
and 1563.</div>

<p>In 1549 and 1550 the price of provisions was again high,
and the people were mutinous. A proclamation
was therefore issued fixing the price of corn, butter,
poultry, and other provisions. Letters were written
to the justices and to the Lords-Lieutenant, and a
commission was appointed to enforce its execution<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. But the
whole series of orders was disobeyed and the misery caused by
this year of scarcity partially accounts for the rebellions, which
ended in the fall of Somerset, and nearly upset the Government
altogether. Other instructions were sent out in 1561<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>: the
difficulty was a frequently recurring one. The years of high-priced
corn were years of riot, and resulted in constantly
increasing efforts of the Privy Council on behalf of the poor.
We shall see that in future years of scarcity the same difficulties
arise, and similar measures are taken. But, as more experience
was gained, there was less attempt to regulate prices, and more
to directly organise the relief of the poor, so that the efforts to
improve the administration of the poor law were closely connected
with the measures to provide corn for the poor in years
of scarcity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Letters
of the Privy
Council to
particular
local officials
in connection
with the
relief of the
poor.</div>

<p>These orders of 1528 and 1549 were general in their
character, and referred, either to large districts, or
to the whole country. But the Privy Council also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>began to interfere with the relief of the poor by
urging particular local officials to do their duty.
This kind of action is illustrated by the letters
addressed to the rulers of Kingston-upon-Hull in
1542 and of London in 1569.</p>

<p>In 1542 letters were sent by order of the Council to
Kingston-upon-Hull, requiring the mayor to fix the price of
provisions, "as the worckmen sent thither by the King's Ma<sup>tie</sup>
might live upon theyre wages<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>." Other letters were sent to the
rulers of London in March<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and June 1569 ordering them to be
diligent in enforcing the laws against vagrants, and the letter
of June 1569 also directly concerns the relief of the impotent
poor.</p>

<p>"It will be necessarye," runs the letter, "to provide
charitablie for suche as shalbe indede founde unfaynedlie impotent
by age, syckness or otherwise to get theire livinge by
laboure and for those wee earnestlie, and in the name of God,
as wee ar all commanded, requyre and chardge youe all and
evry of youe to consider diligentlie howe suche of theme as

charitable good dede etc.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>"</p>

<p>Thus before 1569 the Privy Council find it necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>enforce measures for the relief of the poor, though not to any
very great extent. Their interference occurs especially in years
of scarcity, and forms part of a series of measures undertaken
with the object of preserving order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Legislation
concerning
the relief
of the poor
during the
reign of
Henry VIII.</div>

<p>We have now to see what was the course of legislation
during this period, although legislation was not the
factor which was most important in creating the
system of poor relief before 1569. Not only did
the regulations of the advanced towns suggest the
provisions of the statutes, but even when the
statutes were passed, there is not much evidence that they
were enforced, except when the town government was vigorous.
They are important, not so much because of their immediate
effect, as because they led to the later legislation of Elizabeth,
and because they are authoritative expressions of the opinion of
the time.</p>

<p>During the reign of Henry VIII. two statutes were passed.
The 22 Henry VIII. cap. 12, was designed to prevent those who
were not really impotent from begging, and to punish more
effectively the able-bodied vagrant.</p>

<p>The preamble states, that the number of vagabonds was not
"in any part diminished but rather daily augmented and increased."
In the country, the justices of the peace and, in the
towns, the mayors, bailiffs etc. were the officers responsible for
the execution of the statute. They were ordered to search for
the impotent poor of their districts and to give them letters
authorising them to beg within certain limits. All beggars
who begged outside the specified limits or without a license
were to be put in the stocks. The impotent beggars were thus
confined to a particular neighbourhood but were allowed under
restrictions to beg for their subsistence. Poor scholars, shipwrecked
mariners, and released prisoners might only beg if
properly licensed. Otherwise they, or any other "valiant
beggars," were to be taken to any justice or to the high
constable, and by order of these authorities were to be whipped
in the nearest market town. After punishment the vagrants
had to swear to return to the place where they were born or
last dwelt three years, and there to work for their living. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
certificate was to be furnished to each of them stating the place
and day of punishment, the place where the beggar was to go
and the time he was allowed to get there. While on the way
he was free from whipping, but if he exceeded his time or went
elsewhere he was liable to be whipped whenever caught. Not
only were able-bodied beggars punished, but those who gave
alms to them were also to be fined, although the old practice
of giving doles was allowed to continue, and the masters and
governors of hospitals were excluded from the operation of
the Act.</p>

<p>The main principles of the statute are identical with those
enacted under Richard II., but the directions are much more
detailed. Moreover provision was also made for the punishment
of the inhabitants of any district where the statute was not
executed. The regulations adopted are very similar to those
already in force in London, where impotent beggars were
already badged and sturdy ones whipped at the cart's
tail.</p>

<p>The provisions are chiefly repressive; designed to limit the
number of beggars rather than to provide relief. For this
reason therefore they were not effectual, and a second statute
(27 Hen. VIII. c. 25) was passed also in this reign. This Act was
probably drawn up by Henry himself and is similar to measures
passed at almost exactly the same time in France and Scotland.
The preamble refers to the former statute and states that, "forasmuch
as it was not provided what was to be done when the
sturdy beggars and impoant poor arrived in their hundreds
nor how the inhabitants were to be charged for their relief and
for keeping at work the able-bodied, it is now ordered that the
authorities of the Cities, Shires, etc." are to "charitably receive"
the beggars and relieve them "by way of voluntary and
charitable alms in such wise that none of them shall be compelled
to wander idly and openly ask alms." The same officers
are also to compel the valiant beggars to be kept at continual
labour so that they may earn their own living.</p>

<p>Very few people were excepted from the operation of these
provisions. Beggars with letters, travelling home at the rate
of ten miles a day, are to be relieved; lepers and bedridden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
people may remain where they are; friars mendicant may
beg and receive as they have been accustomed; and servants,
leaving their service and having letters to that effect, may
be free for a month from the operation of the statute. But
with these exceptions, all who have not work or property were
to be set to work or relieved. Authority was also given for the
compulsory apprenticing of vagrant children, between the ages
of five and fourteen, and thus for the first time this prominent
feature of the later administration of poor relief appears in
a statute. The execution of these provisions involved considerable
expenditure, and the Act therefore proceeds to provide
for the raising of funds. The Mayor or Governor of every city,
borough and town corporate, and the churchwardens, with
two others of every parish, were to collect alms every Sunday.
This plan is similar to that already adopted in London where,
in 1533, the aldermen were ordered to supervise the Sunday
collections for the poor. There was no attempt at compulsion,
but parsons, vicars and curates, when preaching, hearing confessions
or making wills were to exhort people to be liberal.
Certain games were forbidden by the same Act and the fines
for breaking this or any part of the statutes were to go to the
poor.</p>

<p>Alms were not to be given by the individual to any casual
beggar but were to be placed in a common box, and doles were
to be given only in the same fashion. As a rule each parish
thus supported its own poor, but rich parishes were to help
poor ones when necessary. Although a great deal of restriction
was placed upon the casual almsgiver by these regulations
there were many loopholes by which he might still evade the
law. It remained lawful to relieve fellow parishioners, shipwrecked
mariners and blind or lame people, lying by the wayside.
Moreover certain poor people might be authorised to
collect broken meat. Noblemen might give to anyone and
abbots and friars were commanded to give as before.</p>

<p>This statute is the first in which the state not only enacts
that the poor shall be provided for in their own neighbourhood,
but also makes itself responsible for the administration of
relief and the raising of funds. At the same time the clause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which provided that all alms were to be voluntary and that if
they were insufficient the officers were not to be fined, made
the Act only permissive in practice, for it could only be enforced
when the inhabitants of a district chose voluntarily to provide
the necessary money.</p>

<p>In this statute, as in the 22 Hen. VIII. c. 12, a double set
of officials for the administration of the law is provided. The
funds were to be raised in every parish, but the mayor, as well
as the churchwardens, was responsible for the collection of the
parochial alms in the towns, and the municipal officers were
the people who were mainly responsible for receiving and
relieving the vagabonds and poor within their jurisdictions.
Thus, not only do these two statutes make general the practices
which existed in London before the statutes were passed, but
they also place their execution in the hands of the same
authorities. So far, however, the orders of both Parliament
and the towns were directed far more to the repression of
beggars than to the collection and administration of funds for
the relief of the poor. Legislators seem to have thought that
sufficient funds already existed, or could be easily collected,
and carefully avoided all approach to compulsory payments for
this purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. The
two earlier
statutes of
Edward VI.</div>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries this was no
longer the case. No other statute was passed in
Henry's reign, but between 1547 and 1569 there
were many and, as a rule, these relate chiefly to
expedients for raising money.</p>

<p>A statute of 1547, however, relates mainly to vagrants<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.
It provided that a sturdy beggar might be made a slave for
two years, and if he ran away a slave for life. The sons of
vagrants also might be apprenticed until they were twenty-four,
and the daughters until they were twenty, while the
punishment of rebellion was slavery. This Act is often condemned
as being the most severe Act of a savage series. It
is, however, quite possible that it was not considered so savage
in 1547. It must be remembered, that under the existing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>law an "incorrigible rogue" was punishable with death<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, and
that this very punishment of servitude is suggested in More's
<cite>Utopia</cite> as a much milder and better punishment than death
for both petty thieves and vagrants. The regulation certainly
altogether failed, for this part of the statute was repealed two
years later: so far as able-bodied beggars were concerned, the
22 Hen. VIII. c. 12 was reenacted and the whipping punishment
there provided remained in force until 1572.</p>

<p>The statute of 1547 also made some additions to the provision
for the impotent poor. Cottages were to be erected for
their habitation, and they were to be relieved or cured. This
clause was again reenacted by the second statute concerning
the poor of Edward's reign<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. At the same time the apprenticeship
regulations were made less severe, and justices were
empowered to liberate children on any proof of the misconduct
of master or mistress.</p>

<p>The next poor law of the reign<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> chiefly concerns the collection
of funds, and was passed in 1551-2.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Legislation
between
1551 and 1569.</div>

<p>The officers responsible for the execution of the
statute were sometimes municipal and sometimes
parochial. The mayor or head officer was to act in the towns;
the parson and churchwardens in the country. These officers
were ordered to call the householders together and to nominate
two collectors who were to gather the alms of the parish, and
it is provided that the collectors "shall gentellie aske" of every
man what he will consent to give weekly for the relief of the
poor. The various sums were to be entered in a book and
collected every Sunday. If any man refused to give, he was
to be exhorted by the parson, and, if the parson failed to
persuade him, he was to be sent to the Bishop. The Bishop
was to induce him to contribute and "according to his discretyon
take order for the reformacon therof<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>." The Bishop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>was also to see to the proper employment of sums granted to
the poor by Henry VIII., unless they had been taken away
by an Act of Parliament. This same statute also enacted that
none were "to goo or sitt openlie a begging," but in this
respect was in advance of the time, for during Mary's reign
licensed beggars were again allowed<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, though the remaining
provisions of this statute were continued or reenacted several
times before 1563<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Early in the reign of Elizabeth, however,
a fresh step is taken towards the enforcement of compulsory
poor rates. The 5 Eliz. c. 3 originated in the House of Lords,
and may have been due to the fact that the Bishops found
unavailing their exhortations to stingy parishioners<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>a person obstinately refused to give to the poor after the
Bishop had duly exhorted him, he might be bound by a
recognisance of £10 to appear before the justices of the peace
in the country or the mayor, bailiff, &amp;c. in the towns. The
justices or mayors were to "charitably and gentelly perswade
and move the said obstinate persons" to extend his or their
charity towards the relief of the poor of the parish where they
dwelt. If any of them again refused, the justices of the peace
or mayor and churchwardens might assess what sum he should
pay weekly; if he still remained obdurate he might be imprisoned.</p>

<p>It was in this hesitating way that the law first resorted to
compulsory payments for the poor. The utmost care is taken
to make the contribution as voluntary as possible and only to
resort to force when much persuasion had proved ineffectual.
Even then compulsion might only be resorted to in the case of
obstinate individuals; it was not legally permissible to assess
the amount that everyone should give until 1572.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. Summary.</div>

<p>This statute of 1563 was the last enactment dealing with
poor relief passed before 1569. In principle, legislation
has altered little since the second statute of
Henry VIII. In 1569, as in 1535-6, a sharp distinction is
drawn between the able-bodied beggars and the impotent.
The former are to be whipped and sent to their parish to
work; the latter are to be provided for by their fellow
parishioners. In both periods also the state appointed
municipal or parochial officials to collect funds and to relieve
the poor. But there is a great difference in the details of the
statutes. The laws of Edward VI. and the first statute of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Elizabeth concerning the poor carefully state who are responsible
for the execution of each part of the Act and provide
penalties for neglect. The two statutes of Henry VIII. are
more detailed than the statutes of Richard II. but they were
not detailed enough; the enactments of Edward, Mary and
Elizabeth add still more precise provisions to secure the better
execution of the law<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. But there is an even greater difference
with regard to funds. The laws of Henry presuppose that the
poor will obtain sufficient relief from voluntary alms; the
statutes of Edward VI. and Mary prescribe the persuasion, and
those of Elizabeth the compulsion of the contributors. Society
had become too complicated for individual action to be effectual
either in restraining idle beggars or in relieving the helpless
poor: the duty was therefore undertaken by the state. It
seemed at first as if the old voluntary character of the gift
could be maintained, but this was soon found to be impossible.
Throughout this period, so far as legislation is concerned, an
approximation to compulsory poor rates accompanies the increase
of the public administration of relief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. The
action of the
rulers of
particular
towns precedes
the
action of
Parliament.</div>

<p>Before 1569 no effectual system of poor relief had been
established, but many experiments had been made.
At the beginning of the century a serious problem
was before the Government. The social changes of
the time had resulted in the formation of crowds of
vagrants, and the greater complexity of economic
conditions made the position of the workfolk more
unstable. Even in ordinary times, therefore, the vagabonds
were a constant plague to the peaceful citizen, and when corn
was dear or work was slack the greater number of the inhabitants
of particular districts, being without resources, joined
in riots or rose in insurrections. There were then no Friendly
Societies or workmen's clubs, and no casual wards or workhouses.
Years of scarcity were therefore always times of
disorder and the peace of the whole country was threatened.
Assistance given by means of private charity, monasteries and
hospitals failed to relieve the distress or to remedy the evil.
Force was tried; thieves were hanged and vagabonds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
whipped. But, even as early as 1515, Sir Thomas More saw
that the root of the evil was much deeper, "Neither ther is any
punishment so horrible, that it can kepe them from stealynge,
which have no other craft, whereby to get their living<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>."</p>

<p>Even before 1569 the statutes had appointed authorities
both for the collection of funds and for the distribution of
relief, and had made contributions to the poor compulsory.
But, on the whole, the practice of London and certain other
towns was in advance of the regulations of the statutes; the
main feature of the period is the municipal organisation of
poor relief. London in 1547 and Ipswich in 1557 had made
regulations for levying compulsory payments for the poor, long
before any statute had authorised the exaction of compulsory
payments for this purpose. Nor is this the only matter in
which the regulations of the towns seem to suggest the provisions
of the statutes. Before the 22 Hen. VIII. had ordered
vagabonds to be whipped at the cart's tail, London vagabonds
had been so treated; before the 27 Hen. VIII. had ordered
the collection of alms for the poor on Sunday by municipal
and parochial authority, that method had been adopted in
London. London, Cambridge, and Ipswich had, before 1569,
built up an elaborate organisation for dealing with the poor,
an organisation that seemed complete, but failed because it was
municipal and not national.</p>

<p>The history of the legislation of the time thus shows that
the Tudor Poor Laws did not, like modern Factory Acts, initiate
regulations never before enforced. On the contrary, the provisions
of these statutes reveal the beginnings of the national
system, following the same line of development as that which
had already been reached by many particular towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Advantages
of
the municipal
system
of relief.</div>

<p>There were some advantages connected with this independent
municipal action, which is thus characteristic
of the relief of the poor before 1569. It was
possible for the central Government to estimate the
practical effect of their measures before they became
law, because they were already probably adopted in some
towns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>Another advantage that belonged to the municipal organisation
of the times was the close connection that existed
between the authorities who administered poor relief and those
who administered charities. Most of the London charities
seem to have belonged either to the parishes or to the Companies.
The parochial charities were administered by authorities
closely connected with those responsible for the public
system of poor relief in the parishes, and the City charities
were administered by authorities closely connected with the
public system of poor relief in the City. Moreover the work of
all the parishes was controlled by the same central authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Connection
between
the
municipal
organisation
of poor relief
and the dissolution
of the
monasteries.</div>

<p>The connection between the municipal organisation of
poor relief and the dissolution of the monasteries is
not altogether clear. Long before 1536 the difficulty
of repressing beggars was serious, and the
alms of the townsfolk were wasted upon unworthy
recipients. Between 1514 and 1533 London had
already taken measures both to restrain and license
its beggars and to collect alms for the poor. It is probable,
that had the monasteries continued to exist, these measures
must have extended. But the existence of the doles of the
monasteries was in itself an obstacle to the better government
of beggars, because the relief given by them was in no way
controlled by the same authorities. In London the hospital of
Savoy preserved during the reign of Mary an independent
existence, side by side with the hospitals under central management,
and we find that the City authorities complained of even
this one hospital, and said the beggars there relieved were
a cause of disorder, and a hindrance to the good government of
the City. Had all the old monasteries and hospitals maintained
an independent existence it is difficult to see how the regulations
of the town rulers could have had much effect, unless the
religious endowments also had been subject to municipal control.
Moreover the monasteries had relieved many poor at their
gates, and among the monks and nuns themselves were
probably many who were unfit for the battle of life. These
people had to be provided for as well as the unrelieved poor of
former days. The immediate need was therefore greater after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
1536 than it had been before. At the same time responsibility
in the matter fell more directly on the citizens. While the
old religious foundations existed, it was supposed that they
ought to provide for the poor; now they were destroyed, the
responsibility must be fixed elsewhere. It was the citizens
whom Latimer and Lever blamed for neglect. Moreover some
of the spoils of the dissolution fell into the hands of the
municipal rulers, and sometimes they were charged with administering
them for the use of the poor. This would certainly
facilitate their action and would perhaps lead them to consider
the relief of the poor especially as a municipal duty. Something
of the kind seems to have happened at York, and possibly
also at Cambridge.</p>

<p>In any case it is certain that, after 1536, the citizens of
London set themselves much more vigorously to work to deal
with the poor; that the royal hospitals were founded partly
from the dissolved monasteries, and that the foundation of these
hospitals first led to the compulsory taxation of 1547 for the
poor in London, and called into existence the governors for the
poor. Municipal care for the poor therefore existed before the
dissolution of the monasteries, but became much more extensive
afterwards, both because the need was greater and because the
rival authority was suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Relation
of beggary
to first
schemes of
relief.</div>

<p>The close relation between beggars and the new system of
poor relief is also apparent. The first efforts of
Town Councils and Parliament were occasioned by
the great increase in the number of begging poor;
the earliest orders concern the punishment of able-bodied
beggars; the others were left to voluntary charity.
But the able-bodied beggars were sometimes unable to obtain
work and the impotent beggars were sometimes unrelieved.
The system of the royal hospitals of the City of London was
founded by the City rulers to meet these difficulties. They
considered especially three kinds of beggars; children, sturdy
beggars, and the impotent poor; they built or refounded all
the hospitals in order to provide for one or other of these
classes. Occasionally begging was forbidden altogether, but as
a rule beggars were not altogether banished, but some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were provided for in hospitals or by pensions, and the rest
were licensed. As soon as the system was established, even
as early as 1557, the distinction between beggars and other
poor was clearly seen and recognised, but still, it is true, that
the organisation first grew up in order to lessen the number of
vagabonds, and chiefly concerned beggars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Parental
government.</div>

<p>Still the regulations of the town rulers were not entirely
confined to beggars. The articles, drawn up "at
the meting of the towneship of Burye the XIIII<sup>th</sup>
daie of Januarye 1570" (1571), illustrate the sort
of family duty recognised by the municipalities towards their
members, and the corresponding right of interfering with
individual freedom. After commanding everyone to go to
church on Sunday, the next regulation orders every person
"suspected of loytring" to declare to the constable every
Sunday in the morning "where he wrought everie daie in the
said weeke," and "if any labourer shall not be provided of
worke on the Sondaie for the weeke following, then the curate
or cunstable to move the parishe for worke." The burgesses
also order a certain Agnes Servall to go to service before Easter
and in the meantime "to keep her church on the sabbath
days. If she failed to do so both mother and daughter were to
be whipped<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>." The town discipline was severe however much
the parental rulers might look after the welfare of all the
inhabitants. The relief of the poor was very closely connected
with parental government of this kind. But both the suppression
of beggars and the exercise of this family responsibility
on the part of municipality or state involved means of
coercion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Bridewell.</div>

<p>The institution of Bridewell was therefore the keystone of
the whole system. Vagrants were not reformed by
whipping or by the fear of hanging, because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>preferred to run the chance of capture when starvation was
the alternative. Unorganised almsgiving failed even more
conspicuously. But organised relief accompanied by a House
of Correction was a step towards the solution of the problem.
It also was in full harmony with the parental idea of government
and the practice of state regulation of economic matters
which existed throughout the reigns of the Tudors and earlier
Stuarts.</p>

<p>The creation of the first Bridewell and the organisation
depending upon it was the work of the citizens of London. It
needed great liberality: gifts were then for the most part
voluntary, and the result shows considerable public spirit on
the part of the richer classes and a great sense of the corporate
unity of the City by the whole body of citizens. It is true
that the liberality did not last; that the isolated action of
single towns could not deal with a national difficulty, but the
town rulers began to make experiments, to train officials and to
create the custom of relieving the poor. They did not themselves
succeed in solving the problem, but without their incomplete
regulations the national organisation of the future
would hardly have been possible.</p>

</ul>


<p>The action of municipal authorities in particular towns,
which, before 1569, is the main feature in the development in
the English system of poor relief, becomes of relatively less
importance after that date.</p>

<p>Matters concerning the poor attract increased notice in
Parliament and the statutes become more definite and more
effective until 1597. An enactment was then passed, the provisions
of which, as re-enacted in 1601, have remained almost
unaltered until the present century. The leading feature
therefore of the period from 1569 to 1597 is the improvement
in legislation. But besides the improvement in legislation we
must notice the pressure exercised by the Privy Council on the
justices of the peace. This becomes more operative and
frequent throughout the reign of Elizabeth, but before 1597
it had not attained anything like the same degree of success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that it was destined to achieve under Charles I. At the same
time local organisation must not be altogether neglected, and
now the measures of the justices in the country are important
as well as the orders of the towns.</p>

<p>We will consider, therefore, so far as they affect the poor,
first, the Parliamentary history from 1569 to 1597; secondly,
the action of the Privy Council; lastly, some of the more important
local measures and the events of the concluding years of
the period 1594 to 1597.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A. Parliamentary
history.</div>

<p>The history of the Bills, committees and debates in Parliament
in the period from 1569 to 1597 shows very
clearly that the English Poor Law did not come
by chance, but was the result of the thought and
experience of the greatest men of the time. Their discussions
make us realise, that in those days, as in ours, opinion was
much divided on the subject, and that in matters concerning
the poor it is particularly true that there is very little new
under the sun. The earlier part of the parliamentary history
of the question circles round the statutes of 1572 and 1576,
the later round the code of 1597. Between these two dates
there were some slight alterations and additions to the law and
a decided change in opinion and feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Discussions,
Bills and
Statutes between
1566 and
1576.</div>

<p>In 1566, we find notes in Cecil's handwriting on a scheme
for preventing a dearth of grain and on the definition
of the word "vagabond." He jots down the
words "bearwardes," "Tynkers" and "pedlars," as
if he were the author of the definition<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> of "vagabond"
that was to cause so much difference of opinion in 1572.</p>

<p>These notes were possibly the basis of two Bills which were
introduced into Parliament in the session of 1566. One concerned
the punishment of vagabonds and loiterers and was
introduced into the House of Commons; the other concerned
the provision of grain and was considered by the Lords<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. In
neither case did the Bills become law, but it is worth noticing
that the question of the provision of grain had been discussed
in Parliament as in 1572, and in 1586 the Privy Council again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>took action in the matter. In 1571 a new Bill, concerning the
punishment of vagabonds and the relief of the poor was introduced,
and there was an interesting debate on the first reading<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.
One of the chief speakers, Mr Sands, subsequently took a
considerable part in the discussion of 1597. He considered
that this Bill of 1571 was "over-sharp and bloody" and thought
that milder measures would be more successful. If justices
would take the trouble, he said, every man might be relieved
at his own home: this was clearly feasible because it was
actually done in the county of Worcester. Sir Francis Knollys
also spoke and was on the sterner side. He would have had
a Bridewell in every town, and have had it maintained by a
fine of twelvepence from every "Tippler<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>." This is a good
illustration of the way in which Bridewell, an institution
originally peculiar to London, influenced the discussions in
Parliament and was there suggested as a type or model for
similar institutions throughout the country.</p>

<p>Another speaker was Mr Thomas Wilson, to whom we owe
the organisation of the Record office of his time. Like a
modern secretary of the Charity Organisation Society he told
his hearers that "it was no charity, to give to such a one, as
we know not, being a stranger unto us."</p>

<p>No statute followed this discussion of 1571, but when
Parliament again met in 1572 a Bill was brought into the
House of Lords which finally became law. The main feature of
the debate in 1572 was a dispute between the Lords and the
Commons as to the definition of the word "vagabond." The
definition in the Act includes<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> (1) proctors or procurators;
(2) persons "using subtyll craftye unlawful Games" and
"fayninge themselves to have knowledge in Phisnomye, Palmestrye,
and other abused Scyences"; (3) all able-bodied persons
not having either "land or maister" who cannot give a satisfactory
account of their means of livelihood; (4) all "fencers,
Bearewardes, Comon Players in Enterludes and minstrels" not
belonging to a Baron or other honourable person of greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>degree and all "Juglers, Pedlars, Tynkers and Petye Chapmen"
unless the bearwards, tinkers etc. were licensed by two justices
of the peace; (5) common labourers, able to work, who refuse
to work for the customary wages; (6) all counterfeiters of
passes and all who use them knowing them to be counterfeit;
(7) all scholars of Oxford and Cambridge who beg without
being licensed by Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor; (8) all shipmen
not properly licensed; (9) all liberated prisoners who beg
without a license, and lastly (10) all persons declared vagabonds
by the clauses of the Act which concern the impotent
poor. A great many people were thus affected by the Act;
the unauthorised beggar, the workman on strike, the poor
scholar at the Universities, unless he were duly licensed, and
the shipwrecked mariner, as well as the fortune-teller and the
proctor or collector of subscriptions. All these were abandoned
to their fate, but the clause concerning the suppression of
"minstrells, bearwards, pedlers etc." caused a dispute between
the Lords and the Commons<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>. These men took the place
which shops, circuses and newspapers occupy in the life of
to-day, and their total suppression would have meant a considerable
loss in the country life of Merry England. After
discussion the two houses agreed upon a compromise; it was
arranged that these people should be allowed if licensed by
two justices of the peace, and the Bill became law as the
14 Eliz. c. 5.</p>

<p>The regulations concerning vagrants are severe, more severe
than in any other Act except the slavery statute of 1547. For
a first offence, a vagabond was to be whipped and bored through
the ear, unless someone would become surety for him and keep
him in service for a year. For a second offence, he was to be
adjudged a felon, unless he could find a surety who would take
him into his service for two years; and for a third offence the
vagrant was to be adjudged a felon without clergy and might
be punished with death<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Special regulations refer to some of the pauper immigrants
of the time. In the days of Elizabeth these came chiefly, not
from the Continent, but from Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The unfortunate people were to be punished as sturdy vagrants
and sent home again, while the people who brought them over
were to be fined twenty shillings for each immigrant.</p>

<p>But "forasmuche as Charitye would that poore, aged and
impotent persons should as necessarylye be provided for, as the
said Roges, Vacabondes and Sturdye beggars repressed" the
clauses of the enactment deal with relief as well as with repression.
The justices of the peace were to make a register
of the names of the poor in every parish and habitations were
to be found for them. Every month the mayor and high
constable were to make search for the strange poor and were
to send them back to their own neighbourhood.</p>

<p>When the poor had been thus settled the justices in the
country and mayors in the towns were to estimate how much
it would cost to maintain them. They were then "by their
good discretions" to "taxe and assesse all and every the Inhabitauntes,"
dwelling in their divisions, "to suche weekely
charge as they and everye of them shall weekely contribute
towardes the Releef of the said poore People."</p>

<p>The mayors and justices were also to appoint collectors and
overseers, and the "obstinate person" who refused to contribute
was to be brought before two justices and sent to gaol unless he
became obedient.</p>

<p>Thus the Act of 1572 does not enforce compulsory payments
in the case of obstinate individuals only, like the statute
of 1562-3; it also enforces the compulsory payment of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>assessed sum upon all the parishioners. The admonition of the
bishop is succeeded by the compulsion of the law. This clause
of the Act, however, still expresses hesitation; if the parishioner
failed to pay, the poor rate could not be immediately distrained;
the offender must be brought before two justices and if he
remained disobedient was to be sent to gaol. The old theory,
that gifts for the poor were good for the giver and should be
voluntary, thus still left its traces though henceforward the
compulsory poor rate was a part of English law.</p>

<p>In this respect the statute merely adopts a principle which
we have seen was already enforced in some of the towns, and
its chief regulations do not in any way alter the control of
relief exercised by the municipal authorities. On the contrary,
the mayors or other head officers are expressly ordered to take
the initiative in the towns and are made legally responsible
for the execution of the law.</p>

<p>Although the clauses against vagabonds are so unusually
severe in this statute the provision for the employment of the
poor is very small. This deficiency was therefore supplied by
an Act passed four years afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18 Eliz. c. 3.</div>

<p>By a statute passed in the Parliament of 1575-6 a stock
of wool, flax, hemp, iron or other stuff was to be
provided in every city and corporate town and in
every market town when thought necessary by the justices "to
the Intente Yowthe may be accustomed and brought up to
Laboure and Worke, and then not lyke to growe to bee ydle
Roges and to the Entente also that suche as bee alredye growen
up in ydlenes and so Roges at this present maye not have any
juste excuse in sayeng they cannot get any Service or Worcke ...
and that other poore and needye persons being willinge to
worcke maye bee set on worcke." Moreover Houses of Correction
were to be built in every county and thither were to be
sent all who refused to do the work provided for them<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>These two Acts of 1572 and 1576 were three times continued<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
and remained the basis of the English Poor Law until
the whole question was reopened and thoroughly discussed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>1597. In 1593, however, the clauses relating to the death,
imprisonment and boring through the ear of vagabonds were
repealed and the whipping punishments of the 22 Hen. VIII.
were again revived<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Legislation
between
1576 and 1597.</div>

<p>Between 1576 and 1597 three other statutes were passed
dealing with special aspects of the subject. The
31 Eliz. c. 7 was designed to prevent an increasing
number of poor families from settling in the
country. Only one family might live in one house and no house
was to be built in the country unless it had four acres of land
attached<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. The 35 Eliz. c. 6 was passed to prevent an increasing
number of poor families from settling in London.
In the cities of London and Westminster and for three miles
round no new houses were to be built except for people who
were assessed in the subsidy book at £5 in goods or £3 in
lands. No existing houses were to be divided into tenements
and no "inmates<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>" were to be received.</p>

<p>A third Act also passed in 1592-3 made special provision
for soldiers and sailors. They were ordered to return to their
own neighbourhoods, and the justices were empowered to levy
an additional rate for their relief, which was to be distributed
to them by Treasurers appointed in every county for the
purpose<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>But it was in 1597 that the many aspects of legislation
affecting the poor were thoroughly discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. The Bills
and Statutes
of 1597.</div>

<p>During the years from 1594 to 1597 there
was a great dearth of corn and the price rose in
some cases to four or five times the average price of the preceding
years. There were rebellions in many parts of the
country and great distress in all. Parliament met on the 24th
Oct. 1597 and the first measure read a first time by the House
of Commons was one dealing with forestallers, regrators and
engrossers of corn<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Francis Bacon then spoke about enclosures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>For "Inclosure of grounds," he said, "brings depopulation, which
brings first Idleness; secondly decay of Tillage; thirdly subversion
of Houses and decay of charity, and charges to the Poor;
fourthly impoverishing the state of the realm." He therefore
brought forward two Bills on the subject, "not drawn with a
polished pen, but with a polished heart, free from affection and
affectation<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>." A committee was appointed to consider the
matter, which was to meet in the Exchequer Chamber in the
afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p>Later, Mr Finch addressed the House, "shewing sundry
great and horrible abuses of idle and vagrant persons greatly
offensive both to God and the world; and further shewing the
extream and miserable estate of the Godly and honest sort of
the poor Subjects of this realm," and it was decided that these
matters also should be referred to the committee already
appointed for enclosures<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>A few days later Sir Francis Hastings complained that this
committee had so far "spent all their travel only about the
said Inclosures and Tillage, and nothing about the said rogues
and poor<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>." He therefore asked that Bills on these subjects
should be considered by the House. At least seventeen Bills
concerning this matter were brought forward during the Session
of 1597-8, and on Nov. 19th a large and influential committee
was appointed to which thirteen of these Bills were referred.
To this committee belonged some of the most famous men in
the House, for it included amongst its members Sir Francis
Bacon, Sir Thomas Cecil and Sir Edward Coke. There were
others also who seem to have had special knowledge in matters
concerning the poor, such as Edward Hext, a justice of Somerset,
who had already written a long letter to Cecil concerning
vagabonds; and Sir Thomas Wroth, who seems to have been the
special champion of the poor<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. Their meetings were held in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Middle Temple Hall and continued for the greater part of the
Session<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>The titles of twelve of the Bills then considered give us
some idea of the many sides of the question that were then
discussed. The following drafts were submitted; the Bill for
"erecting of Houses of Correction and punishment of rogues
and sturdy beggars and for levying of certain sums due to the
poor," for the "necessary habitation and relief of the poor,
aged, lame, and blind in every parish," for "relief of Hospitals,
poor prisoners and others impoverished by casual losses," for
"supply of relief unto the poor," for "petite forfeitures," for
"the better relief of souldiers and mariners," for "the better
governing of Hospitals and lands given to the relief of the
poor," for "extirpation of Beggery," "against Bastardy," "for
setting the poor on work," and "for erecting of hospitals or
abiding and working houses for the poor." These Bills concern
both the relief of the poor and methods of dealing with
vagrants; so far as the former was concerned the committee
rejected all these proposals and brought in a new Bill of their
own. But the Bill for Houses of Correction was amended in
the Commons and sent up to the Lords<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Upper House also there was then much discussion.
A bill "for the relief of the poor in time of extream dearth of
corn" apparently originated there<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. Most interest, however,
was excited by the Bill for Houses of Correction. The Lords
appointed one committee to discuss both Bills and amongst its
members were Lord Burghley and Archbishop Whitgift.
Several amendments were proposed by the committee which
were not at first approved by the whole House. The Lord
Chief Justice was therefore consulted and some, if not all, of
the additions were accepted<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. The Bill was sent down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>House of Commons with the amendments. The Commons
referred the matter to a committee in which Sir Walter Raleigh
took the chief part and which included Francis Bacon, Wroth
and Hext. Raleigh proposed a conference with the Lords on
the subject. The Lords assented to the conference with the
proviso that whatsoever had been amended or added by their
Lordships "could not now be altered by the orders of the
House<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>." Sir Walter Raleigh reported this reply to the
Commons but complained of the manner in which the answer
had been delivered, "not using any of their Lordships' former
and wonted courteous manner of coming down towards the
members of this House to the Bar, but all of them sitting still
in their great Estates very solemnly and all covered<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>." A
somewhat heated discussion arose between the two Houses as
to the way in which the Lords should answer the Commons,
and perhaps the friction occasioned by this means contributed
to the rejection of the Bill by the Commons by 106 Noes to
66 Ayes<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>. A new Bill for rogues was hastily passed through the
House and sent up to the Lords.</p>

<p>The final result of all these discussions, Bills, committees
and disputes was a series of Acts dealing with the problems
concerning vagrants and the poor from many different sides.</p>

<p>The most important Act of the series is the 39 Eliz. c. 3,
formerly the Bill for the relief of the Poor which the great
committee appointed on Nov. 19th in the Commons brought in
after they had discussed twelve other Bills on the subject. By
this Act the relief of the poor was placed mainly in the hands
of the Churchwardens and four Overseers of the Poor who were
to be appointed every year at Easter by the justices of the
peace. These churchwardens and overseers with the consent
of two justices of the peace were to take such measures as were
necessary for setting poor children to work or binding them
apprentice, for providing the adult unemployed with work by
means of a stock of hemp, flax, wool, thread, iron or other
materials and for relieving the impotent, old and blind. For
this last purpose they were empowered to build Hospitals on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>waste lands. The funds were to be raised by the taxation "of
every inhabitant and every occupyer of Landes" and the rates
might be levied by distress. An appeal against the assessment
might be taken to Quarter Sessions but the assessment itself
was to be made by the parochial officers with the consent of
two justices of the peace. Rich parishes might be rated in aid
of poorer ones and the forfeitures for negligence, made under
the Act, were to go to the use of the poor. All beggars were
declared rogues except those who begged for meat and victuals
in their own parish and soldiers or sailors regularly licensed who
were passing to their settlement.</p>

<p>A county rate was also to be levied on the parishes for
the relief of prisoners and for the support of almshouses and
hospitals, and a Treasurer for the County was to be appointed
to administer this relief. Within corporate towns, the head
officers had the same authority as justices of the peace in the
country.</p>

<p>Another Act passed in this year was entitled "An Acte for
the punyshment of Rogues, Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>."</p>

<p>Justices of the peace in Sessions were empowered to take
measures for the erection of Houses of Correction. The old
statutes relating to rogues and Houses of Correction were repealed
and vagabonds were now to be punished by whipping.
They were then to be sent to the House of Correction or gaol
belonging to their place of settlement and from thence were to
be placed in service if able-bodied or in an almshouse if impotent.
If the rogue were likely to be dangerous to anyone he was to
be banished, and if he returned was to suffer death. It is a
curious part of this Act that the minister of the parish and one
other person were to assist by their advice with the punishment
of these rogues.</p>

<p>The Bill for Hospitals probably resulted in a statute which
re-enacted the old provision that during the next twenty years
anyone might found a hospital or House of Correction etc. by
simple enrolment in the Court of Chancery and without Letters
Patent<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. Another of the thirteen Bills considered by the committee
seems to have become law under the title of an "Acte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>to reforme Deceipts and Breaches of Trust towching Lands
given to charitable uses." It was there stated that the lands
appropriated to charitable uses had been misapplied and consequently
power was given to the Lord Chancellor etc. to issue
writs to the Bishop of the Diocese to inquire into any abuses
of the kind and "to set downe such Orders, Judgement and
Decrees as the said good, godly and charitable uses may be
truely observed in full ample and most liberall sort, according to
the true intent and meaning of the founders or donoures
thereof<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>."</p>

<p>Two enactments of this series concern soldiers; one confirms
the statute of 1592-3 and increases the amount of the rate
that justices might impose for their relief<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>; the other provided
especially severe punishments against soldiers, mariners and
idle persons who wandered "as soldyers or mariners." But on
the other hand if a soldier or sailor could not obtain employment
in his parish and applied to two justices of the peace, they
were obliged to find him work and could if necessary tax the
whole hundred for the purpose<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<p>The legislation of this year is therefore almost a complete
code on the subject, but by far the most important part was the
Act concerning the relief of the poor. It was only passed as a
temporary measure but was re-enacted with a few alterations
four years later. It was in 1597, therefore, and not in 1601
that the whole question was discussed and that the main
features of our English system of poor relief were legally
established.</p>

<p>This statute differs from earlier statutes, not in the creation
of Overseers of the Poor but in making them primarily responsible
for the administration of the law. The Act of 1572
first ordered the appointment of Overseers or Collectors. But
the burden of initiating measures then rested primarily on the
justices of the peace and the head officials of the town. On the
other hand the Act of 1597 ordered the overseers to take the
initiative, though the justices had still to assent to their proposals
and had to see that they did their duty. With regard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>however, to soldiers, vagrants and Houses of Correction the
justices were still mainly responsible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. General
features of the
discussion in
Parliament.</div>

<p>For seventy years Parliament had been making legislative
experiments with regard to the public relief of the
poor and before 1597 at least nine different plans
had been tried. At last a law was produced which
as re-enacted four years later is unrepealed at the
present day and for more than two centuries was almost
unaltered.</p>

<p>Parliament grudged neither its own time nor that of its
ablest men to solve the question. The personal side of the
history of the discussion is interesting. We see Sir Francis
Bacon, to use his own phrase, "not with polished pen but with
polished heart," Raleigh neither as courtier nor sea rover but as
a stickler for the privileges of Parliament and leader of a
committee on the poor, Whitgift, not as ecclesiastical disciplinarian,
but as practical philanthropist. Burleigh appears
but seldom in the discussions but he too sat on the committee in
the House of Lords in 1597.</p>

<p>The most important part of the work seems to have been
done by the committee appointed by the Commons on
November 19th. The law for the relief of the poor was a new
Bill framed by the committee after many other Bills had been
considered and seems to have been accepted at once by the
House. This committee was an enormous committee and the
number of bills considered by it was altogether exceptional,
and it is to the meetings of its members in the Middle Temple
Hall that we owe the making of a workable Poor Law and all
its lasting effects on English social life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusions.</div>

<p>Even by looking at the provisions of the statutes, we can
see that opinion on the subject had greatly changed
since 1569. During the earlier years of the period
Parliament tried to exterminate beggary by increasing the
severity of the punishment of beggars. If we except the law of
1547, this policy culminates in the statute of 1572, though,
even in 1572, increased provision for the impotent poor accompanied
increased severity towards able-bodied vagrants. The
Act of 1576 indicates the beginning of a great change of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and policy. Legislators have given up the idea that the
existence of masterless men is entirely owing to the idleness
and wickedness of the men themselves; they provide materials
for employment and Houses of Correction and so recognise that
the evil was partly caused by a want of training and by a want
of work. In 1597 there was a further change; the most severe
punishments against vagrants had been repealed and the most
important part of the legislation of this year was the statute for
the relief of the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. The chief
characteristics
of the action of
the Privy
Council.</div>

<p>We now turn to the second factor in the growth of the
English system of Poor Relief; the pressure exercised
by the Privy Council on the justices of the
peace. The methods employed were twofold;
sometimes general measures were enforced through
the whole country or through large districts of the country,
sometimes pressure was brought to bear only on particular local
officials.</p>

<p>The general measures adopted between 1569 and 1597
consist chiefly of organised searches made for the discovery and
punishment of rogues and special precautions undertaken in
order to prevent sudden alterations in the price of corn. It is
not until 1597 and afterwards that these general measures
concern the relief of the poor in ordinary times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. The
whipping
campaign.</div>

<p>In 1569 there were disturbances in many parts of the
country and a serious rebellion in the North. The
vagabonds of the neighbourhood increased the
disorder and the vagrants of the time were often
rebels. It was probably therefore quite as much for political
as for social reasons that the Privy Council undertook a
whipping campaign against vagrants between 1569 and 1572.
In consequence of the orders of the Council reports were sent
both from the Council of the North and from many justices of
the Southern and Midland Counties. The reports from the
North indicate clearly that these measures for the repression
of vagrants and the relief of the poor were closely connected
with the maintenance of order. In May 1569 the President
of the Council of the North writes thus to the Queen from
York: "We conferred with the justices of the peace in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
county for its good order, and finding great quiet and content
by the good execution of the statute for vagabonds, we have
taken order that once in every month there shall be a secret
search for that purpose throughout the shire, and certificates
sent to us until next November<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>." Almost immediately afterwards
the rebellion in the North broke out and was suppressed.
In December 1572 Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, writes to Lord
Burghley from York and sends a copy of letters and articles
sent to the justices of the peace of every riding and all the
towns named in his commission<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. One of these articles shows
that the valiant rogues were often more than beggars. "To
stay the spreading of false and seditious rumours and the
sending of messages from the late rebels to trouble the quiet
of the realm, order is to be given in market towns and other
places that all suspected passengers, vagabonds, beggars, and
rogues be punished with severity and celerity, according to
the late statute." But even here measures for relieving the
necessitous accompany those for repressing vagrants, and the
justices were ordered to send monthly accounts of the proceedings
taken by them to provide for the poor and impotent.</p>

<p>In the reports from the North the political motives of the
Government are obvious, but the character of the organisation is
shown better in the replies sent by the justices of the Southern
and Midland counties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Nature
of general
measures.</div>

<p>To enforce these measures orders were decided upon by
the Council and then sent with letters directing
their enforcement to the sheriffs and justices of
the peace of every county. These justices reported
to the Council the methods adopted by them to carry
out these orders and the condition of affairs within their jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Many of the reports are still to be found among the State
Papers and afford us considerable information as to the state of
the country and the extent to which the law was executed.
The justices' reports concerning vagrants from 1569 to 1571
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>are preserved from nineteen different counties. These were
made directly to the Privy Council. From some counties like
Gloucester and Northampton there are many reports, but from
others like Lincoln and Hereford only one was returned.
Although the justices of Holland in Lincolnshire only report
once they say they will keep watches every month in order
that vagabonds may be punished and suppressed<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

<p>The accounts from different parts of the country vary very
much. The Oxfordshire answer is usually "All things be
well<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>," but in Northamptonshire there were many vagrants,
and apparently they were mostly sturdy rogues for they were
usually "stocked" and whipped<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. Gloucestershire is a fairly
average county; in the country round Cirencester we are told
there were no "persons disorderly found," but in the division of
Thornbury there were ninety-two vagrant men and fifteen
children. In Tewkesbury and Deerhurst there were fifteen
sturdy vagrants, twenty impotent beggars, and four children<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes great numbers were attracted by particular
causes. Thus from Cambridgeshire some reports state, "No
such kynde of persons there were found<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>," but in four hundreds
forty-seven were arrested, "the number whereof were so greate
at that present by reason of the confluence to and from Sturbridge
fayer<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>When we remember that all the vagrants were taken in two
or three searches only and that it is probable that the more
capable had ample notice, the results indicate a considerable
amount of disorder. On the other hand, the fact that when the
proportions are given so many are impotent, and the frequent
presence of children lead us to believe that these wanderers
were more often people in want than wicked plunderers of their
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>These orders of the Privy Council were directed towards the
decrease of vagrants, but in the replies of the justices we see the
close connection between measures of this kind and the relief
of the poor. Thus in Essex and Surrey advantage was sometimes
taken of the clause permitting the justices to put vagrants
to service. At Barking and Walthamstow masterless men
were appointed to masters, and at Brixton and Wallingford
three out of thirteen were put to service<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. But the report
from Worcestershire is more interesting and confirms the information
derived from the speech made by Mr Sands during
the debate in Parliament on the Bill of 1571<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. The justices
there said that they had already taken measures to repress
beggars and so found very few in the searches now made; the
few that remained there were licensed by them but the "greter
parte of the poore ar provyded for where they dwell<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>." We can
thus see that, though this whipping campaign concerns vagrants,
the question of vagrants was inseparably connected with the
care of the poor, and that these measures, although undertaken
with a view of preserving order, tended to lead to the better
organisation of relief.</p>

<p>The next series of measures undertaken by the Privy Council
concerns therefore the supply of the markets during years of
high-priced corn.</p>

<p>Even in the reign of Henry VIII. London and Bristol had
bought a public store of corn in order to prevent scarcity, and
in 1528 and 1549 the Privy Council had regulated the buying
and selling of grain in order to lower the price but had failed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>obtain much result<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>. Between 1569 and 1597 there were
three seasons in which corn was exceptionally scarce, 1572,
1586, and 1594 to 1597. In each of these the Privy Council
issued similar orders and their action became more vigorous
and more successful as time went on.</p>

<p>The sudden rises in the price of corn were in a great
measure caused by the narrowness of the area from which a
supply could come. There were few means of rapid communication;
the roads were bad and the supplies of grain
available for a particular district might be in the hands of very
few men. It was quite possible for the dealers of corn to
prevent corn from coming to a market, to buy up the supplies
already there and afterwards raise the price to an artificial
height. This was considered unfair according to the commercial
morality of the time, and when it was done in the case
of a necessary of life it caused great hardship to the poor.</p>

<p>In 1572 enquiries were made as to the price of corn in the
Western counties and in Norfolk and Suffolk. The replies
received show that it varied considerably even in adjacent
counties. In Somerset best wheat sold for twenty shillings
a quarter, in Dorset it fetched sixteen, it cost eighteen shillings
in Norfolk, while in Suffolk it would be purchased for only
fourteen<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. The next year a commission was issued and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>commissioners were empowered to order the farmers to bring
corn to market in proportion to the amount they possessed<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>

<p>So far the measures adopted closely resembled those of
1527-8, but in 1586 the organisation had become more developed.</p>

<p>In April and May the Council issued letters to the justices
of the maritime districts and to twenty-three other counties
ordering them to see the markets supplied with corn and to
prevent the abuses of corn-dealers<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. Notwithstanding there were
symptoms of discontent. The workmen in the west of England
were suffering not only because the price of corn was high but
because there was a lack of employment in the cloth trade. At
Romsey certain rioters "pretend that the present dearthe of
corn and want of work hathe mooved them to attempt that
outrage." In Framloyde, Gloucestershire, there was "a mutinee
by the common people, who rifled a bark laden with malt."
The justices responsible for Romsey were told to have regard
to "their Lordships' late letters for the serving of the markettes
and to deale with the principall clothemen and traders theraboutes
for the setting of the people on worke<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>." Letters of the
same kind were also sent to Gloucestershire<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and Somerset.
In the latter we are told that the spinners, carders and workers
of wool lack "their comon and necessarie foode, a matter not
onlie full of pittie in respect of the people but of dangerous
consequence to the state." Her Majesty, therefore, "tendring
the one and careful of th' other" directs the justices to call the
clothiers before them and "require and command such of them
as have stockes and are of habillitie to employ the same as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>have heretofore don so as by them the poore maie be set on
worke<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>."</p>

<p>With regard to the scarcity of corn the Council also took
further action. Burleigh carefully considered and amended
a proclamation for dealing with the difficulty<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>. The three
judges, Popham, Mildmay and Manwood, to whom the matter
was referred for consideration, made a series of recommendations<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>."
These were embodied in a set of orders, the draft of
which is amended in Burleigh's own hand<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. After being signed
by the Council<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> these orders were issued early in 1587 to the
justices throughout the country<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. They probably formed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>nucleus of the Scarcity Book of Orders of the earlier Stuarts
which in turn was the forerunner of the Orders and Directions of
January 1630/1.</p>

<p>These directions of 1587 commanded the appointment of
juries who were to make an elaborate survey of the amount of
corn possessed by everyone, and to state the number of people
belonging to the different households. The justices were then
to allow each owner to retain as much corn as was necessary
for the food of his househood and for seed, but were to order
the rest to be brought to market. They were moreover to use
"all good meanes and perswasions ... that the pore may be
served of corne at convyent and charitable prices." They were
also to see to the execution of the laws for the relief of the
poor, "that the maymed or hurt soldiers and all other impotent
persons be carefullye seene unto to be relieved," and "that the
justices doe their best to have convenient stocke to be provided
in everye division or other place accordinge to the statut for
settinge the pore a worke<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>."</p>

<p>Many reports from the justices were sent to the Council
in answer both to their letters and to the more elaborate set
of orders of 1587. The justices divided themselves so that
some were responsible for each division of the county<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. They
were present on market-days and saw if there were a sufficient
supply of corn, and tried to persuade the owners to sell it at
a moderate price<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. They also took measures to check the
dealers in corn or badgers. A difference of opinion seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>to have existed as to the usefulness of these dealers. The
Privy Council thought them mischievous, but the justices of
Gloucester find them "honestlie demeaning themselves to be
profytable members of this our Commonwelth<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>." The justices
often, as in Norfolk<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>, made detailed enquiries as to the amount
of corn held by each farmer and the number of his household,
and in accordance with the information thus acquired they
ordered, as in Wootton, Oxfordshire, every corn holder to bring
a proportionate quantity of his grain to market<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. In Gloucestershire
they went farther and also fixed the price at which it was
to be sold<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The Privy Council certainly trusted much to the justices,
and both farmers and markets were thoroughly regulated.
One cannot wonder that sometimes the corn owners were disobedient<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>,
though on the whole the orders seem to have been
loyally carried out. Even in our own time the poor of Italy
and Spain have suffered much from an attempted "corner" in
grain in spite of our rapid means of communication and worldwide
source of supply. The circumstances of 1587 must have
made organisation necessary, for the orders were successful, and
when reissued in 1594 it was especially noted that in 1587
they had done "much good for the stay of y<sup>e</sup> dearthe and for
y<sup>e</sup> relieving of y<sup>e</sup> poore<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>."</p>

<p>Already in 1586 additional measures were occasionally
taken for the relief of the labourers and handicraftsmen. In
Norfolk, "the poorer sorte are by persuasion sarved at meaner
pryces<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>"; while in the county of Nottingham a philanthropic
Duke of Rutland adopted the following expedient, afterwards
employed by public authority. When it was known that there
was likely to be a scarcity of grain, the Duke caused his corn
to be sold in small quantities to the poor two shillings and
eight pence under the market price. The justices tell us that
by these means "the greedines of a number was frustrated,
the poore releved, and the expectancy of excessive dearthe
stayed<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>."</p>

<p>But, although the orders issued in 1587 especially command
the provision as well of adequate support for the impotent
as of work for the able-bodied, very few of the replies report
any special action with reference to these matters. There are
however one or two exceptions. Thus Arthur Hopton, a justice
responsible for the hundred of Blithing, states that 500 poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>in adjacent towns were relieved with "bred and other victuall,"
and that this should be continued for twenty-three weeks<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.
Certain justices of Hemlingford also give an especial charge
to the collectors to see that all "the poore aged and impotent
persons w<sup>t</sup>in everie township and hamlet be sufficientlie releeved
as they ought to be," and to "adde a weekelie supplie
to the same former reliefe," if the relief they had previously
ordered were "too slender for them by reason of the dearth."
The justices also especially charge the overseers<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> to see "that
all the poore and idle persons in everie towneship and hamlet
w<sup>ch</sup> are able to labour and want worke be daylie set on worke ...
towards the getting of their living according also to the former
orders made to that effect<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>." But generally the action taken
by the justices both in 1586 and 1587 mainly concerns the
supply of corn. Still the whole organisation was made chiefly
in the interests of the poor, and both the reports and the
orders themselves notice this fact<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1597, as well as in 1586, the Privy Council endeavoured
to supply the poor with corn at reasonable rates, but it
will be more convenient to consider that attempt with the
rest of the events of those years of scarcity from 1594 to
1597<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.</p>

<p>As a rule in the reign of Elizabeth the object of these
scarcity measures was not so much to sell to the poor under
price, as to arrange by organisation that the supply of corn
should be equally distributed over the whole year, and that
consequently the price of corn should be more even for everybody.
It was rather to prevent monopoly than to organise
doles. It was undertaken chiefly in the interests of the poor
because a lack in the supply of corn affected them most; it
did not only mean hardship, it meant starvation. It was
undertaken by the Privy Council partly with the desire of
repressing disorder, because insurrections and scarcity usually
occurred together, and it was the object of the Government
to keep the people in their "obedience<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>." But already the
changed feeling of Parliament is found also in the Privy
Council: measures of organised relief were seen to be the
most effectual method of repression, and the closer study of
the subject resulted in greater care for the poor.</p>

<p>These general measures for the repression of vagrants and
the supply of corn are not only important to our subject because
they directly concern the relief of the poor; they are even
more important on account of their indirect connection therewith.
In the first place these measures brought the authorities
both of the nation and of the country into contact with the
poor, and they were thus led to devise more extensive measures
for bettering the condition of their needy neighbours; it became
more and more a habit with them to regard matters
concerning the poor as a department of Government.</p>

<p>In the second place, by means of these measures dealing
with corn and vagrants the organisation was prepared which
was afterwards used for the administration of the relief of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>poor. The letters of the Privy Council to the justices, the
allotment of the justices to their different divisions, the supervision
of the judges, and the reports to the Privy Council were
all utilised by the system established under Charles I.</p>

<p>If this later system had been administered by a body of
officials untrained in the same kind of work, and unused to
these methods of administration, it would have had little
chance of being well administered. Such degree of success
as was attained must have been at least partially due to the
fact that the measures for the punishment of vagabonds and
for the provision of grain preceded the more detailed orders
for the relief of the poor. The new orders were thus executed
by county and municipal officials trained to similar duties and
used to like methods of administration, and it was in this way
that the Elizabethan measures of scarcity have an important
influence on the growth of the English administration of the
Poor Law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. The influence
of the
Privy Council
upon the
Corporation of
London.</div>

<p>But sometimes the measures of the Privy Council were not
general: pressure was placed only on particular
local officials. We will first examine a few cases
of this kind concerning the City of London. We
have already seen that in 1569 there were two
sharp letters of the Privy Council to the Lord
Mayor censuring him for his neglect in matters concerning the
vagrants and poor<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>. In 1573 the Lord Mayor refers again to
the displeasure of the Council and had apparently received
a similar letter<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. In this way therefore the Privy Council
censured neglect and commanded local officials to remedy the
abuses of their administration.</p>

<p>Sometimes we see the authorities of London asking the
advice of the Council with regard to the measures that they
have themselves prepared. Orders for the poor were drawn up
in 1579 and again in 1594, and in both cases the Lords of the
Privy Council were consulted<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. The Lords of the Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>also call attention to particular difficulties. In 1583 they
recommend special measures to prevent the increase of Irish
beggars<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>, and they repeatedly write to order increased vigilance
in enforcing the regulations against small houses and tenements
which have been newly erected<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. Special matters are sometimes
arranged by them; in 1594 the City rulers are told to
meet the justices of Middlesex in order that they may take
joint action to repress vagrants<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. Even details come under
the notice of the members of the Privy Council, and in 1596
they directed the Lord Mayor to see that the corn in a
particular ship was sold to the poor and not bought up by
dealers<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>.</p>

<p>The Council thus was apparently very well informed as to
the condition of affairs and had power to interfere with effect
even in matters of detail whenever the rulers of London were
inclined to be slothful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9. The pressure
exercised
by the Privy
Council on
other local
authorities.</div>

<p>We have not the same detailed information with regard to
other towns, but we can see that this kind of
action on the part of the Lords of the Council was
by no means confined to London. We find them
writing to Burghley himself and insisting on the
appointment of Provost Marshals in Hertfordshire
and Essex who were to take especial care to repress
vagrants and idle persons<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>; they rebuke the Devonshire
justices for not providing properly for old soldiers and sailors<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.
They write to Cambridge and order that care be taken to
prevent the increase in the number of tenements in the town<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>and they especially commend the Norfolk justices for erecting
a "fourme for the punishment of loyterers, stubborne servantes,
and the settinge of vagabondes, roages and other idle people
to work, after the manner of Bridewell<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>".</p>

<p>There is enough to show that the Privy Council was often
active and that its interference had a considerable effect, but
that before 1597 this interference was only occasionally
exercised.</p>

<p>This pressure exerted by the Privy Council on justices and
municipal authorities becomes the most important factor in the
development of the English system of poor relief in the next
century. Law was not yet enforced merely because it had
been enacted, and in regard to the poor no force of continued
habit as yet made public opinion compel negligent officials to
do their duty. So far men objected to pay rates; they were
not firmly convinced of the duty of the state to relieve the
poor.</p>

<p>The pressure of the Privy Council was therefore necessary
to enforce the law. But the habit of interference in these
matters and the organisation that alone could make interference
have much effect grew very slowly. Before 1597 we can see
this habit of interference and this organisation growing, but as
yet it is only utilised occasionally and to meet some special
emergency; it is not part of a general system which almost
everywhere commanded obedience.</p>

<p>Improvement in the organisation for the relief of the poor
during the period from 1569 to 1597 is found in the local as
well as in the central government. We will now look at the
local side of the question. It is possible to obtain a fair idea of
the kind of action adopted by the rulers of shire and borough
by examining first the measures of London and Norwich in
detail, and secondly some examples of the methods of other

<p>Some of these were designed to carry into effect the Act
of 1572 which we have seen was the first law that gave
statutory authority for compulsory assessment for the relief of
the poor. In Sept. 1572 the Mayor issued a precept to the
aldermen which commanded each in his ward to see that the
constables and other "sad and discrete personnes<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>" made certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>inquiries about the poor of every parish. They were to find out
the names and surnames "of suche aged, decayed and impotent
poore people" as "of necessitie be compelled to lyve by almes,"
and were to ascertain who had been born in the parish or had
lived there three years before the beginning of the last Parliament.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor in issuing this precept relied on the
municipal and not on the parochial authorities. It was apparently
unsuccessful, for later commands were sent to the aldermen
on Sept. 5th ordering them to make these same inquiries
through the churchwardens<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. Three days later more detailed
instructions were given to the same effect. The churchwardens
and other responsible men in every parish were "to examyne
which poore are to be releved in everye of the said parishes and
to be provided for according to the last statute made for that
purpose." The aldermen were to set down the names of the
poor and how long they had dwelt in the City and how much
each of them ought to receive "that they nede not begg."
They were then to make an assessment of "everye Inhabitant
that nowe payeth nothinge" to help his needy neighbours and,
if there was any cause to increase the sum paid by any rich
man, they were to note what increased amount they thought
necessary<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. Thus the old voluntary payments seem to become
the basis of the first assessment under the new statute, while a
few wealthy and stingy givers were coerced.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the fund thus raised was not sufficient
and efforts were made to reduce the expenditure and to
collect the whole of the amount assessed. The aldermen
were to summon the governors of the hospitals and were to
interview the poor people themselves as well as the churchwardens.
They had then the unpleasant task of lowering
the pensions already granted because "the colleccon all readie
appoynted will not serve to advance suche ample pencons."
They had also carefully to see that no one received anything
who was not born in the parish or an inhabitant for the full
time appointed by the statute<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. By these means it was hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>that it would not be necessary to spend more than the sum
raised by this semi-voluntary poor-rate. In March, 1573, the
contributions for the next year became due while some of the
contributions for the previous year were still in arrear; the
Lord Mayor found it necessary to complain of the negligent
execution of the statute for the poor "by reason whearof this
Cittie before this tyme bearinge the name of a Lanterne to all
other the Quene's maiestie's domynions in example of good
order and due execucon of good Laws is accompted to some
farre behynde other places in the due execucon of this statute
to the greate greffe of well willers to the same<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>." Henceforward
every part of the precept concerning the poor was to be "dulye
and carefullie put in execucon."</p>

<p>By next year it was evident that even if the assessments
were properly paid the funds would be insufficient. The Mayor
therefore fell back on the old plan of collections in the
churches after the Sunday sermons<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. An ancient custom of
the City was also utilised. The Companies in state attended
by turns the sermons in Easter week at St Mary's Spittal.
Special collections were then to be made for the poor and the
money given to the Mayor that it might be distributed where
there was most need "by the handes of good and godly citizens<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>."</p>

<p>In these precepts of 1572, 1573, and 1574 the City rulers
employ voluntary methods and avoid compulsory poor-rates as
far as possible. It is however evident that the voluntary
subscriptions were inadequate. The municipal basis of the
organisation is strongly marked; the sums collected under the
assessments were to be paid to the governors of Christ's Hospital
and the chief part of the money seems to have been expended
by the City and not by the parochial officials<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The City rulers also attempted to deal with the poor all over
London by an organisation founded upon a series of orders or
articles for the poor. In 1576 a set of regulations was issued
dealing with the duties of "the parish," of the "constables"
and of "surveyors" with regard to vagrants. The parishioners
were to choose a surveyor every Sunday who was to attend
every night for a week and help the constable in the search for
sturdy beggars. Every fortnight at least the constable, beadle
and churchwardens were to visit the houses of all the poor
people in their districts and were to order any of the new
arrivals who were unable to support themselves without
burdening the parish to be sent away<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. These commands only
concerned vagrants and new comers and are of far less importance
than the regulations of 1579.</p>

<p>In that year orders were issued which if carried out would
have provided methods for dealing with all classes of the poor
and, but for the Elizabethan phrases and Elizabethan whippings,
we should be much more inclined to think that they were
passed by a London County Council in 1899, than by the
Corporation of the City in 1579. In August of that year the
Common Council resolved that "an Acte for the poore" should
be drawn up and considered, and a few days later the book was
read to the Council and "established as a lawe<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>."</p>

<p>There is a double basis for the administration of these
regulations: the vagrants were dealt with by the municipal
system working through the hospitals; the impotent by the
parochial officials. Children and the able-bodied poor came
under the jurisdiction of both. The vagrants were to be
brought to Bridewell and there divided into three classes.
Those who were not diseased and did not belong to the City
were to be "dealt with according to the lawe," that is, they
were to be whipped and sent to their settlement. Those who
were ill were to go to St Thomas's or St Bartholomew's and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>when cured to return to Bridewell and be treated in the same
manner. But the "sturdy beggars" whom "the Cittie by law
is charged to provide for" were to be received into Bridewell:
they were to be "there kept with thin diet onely sufficing to
sustaine them in health" and were to be made to work at the
occupation for which they were most fitted<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. If any vagrant
was skilful in any of these occupations and a citizen were
willing to employ him, the governors were to try to make
arrangements for him to be taken into service. Over the rest
of the London poor also the parochial officials were commanded
to keep a strict watch. In each parish the constable, churchwardens,
collectors and six parishioners were to make a general
survey of all their needy neighbours. The name, age and sex
of each was to be noted and pensions were to be given to those
who were disabled. Children were to go to Christ's Hospital
if there was room, and if not were to be provided for by the
parish. The able-bodied poor were told to make "their mone"
to the churchwardens or collectors and were to obtain a "Bill"
signed by two of them and then to be provided with work at
Bridewell or elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is even suggested both that all the poor should be visited
"daily if it may be ... to see how they apply theyr work" and that
"Such youth, and other as are able to labour and may have worke
and shal be found idle shall have some maner of correction by
the parents, or otherwise as shalbe thought good in the parish.
And if they wyll not amend they shalbe sent to Bridewell to be
reasonably corrected there." Thus the two main features of
these orders were first, that the parochial officers were to
exercise a very strict surveillance over all the poor of their
district and were to provide the impotent poor with outdoor
relief, and secondly, that the City officers were to punish
vagrants and find work for the unemployed. No one was to be
allowed to settle his own affairs; fellow citizens and fellow
parishioners were to provide work and see it done, and were
also to see that the youth of the City were well trained.</p>

<p>Some efforts were made to provide against some of the
difficulties which were likely to hinder the execution of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>commands. In order to lessen the charges as much as possible
the governors were to try to persuade the masters of ships to
engage their men from Bridewell; they also adopted the very
modern expedient of registering the names of employers who
were willing to give work to the poor who were sent to them<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.
The old regulation was reaffirmed that the goods made by the
poor should be sent to the Companies and paid for by them so as
far as possible to prevent competition between the pauper-made
goods and those of the free citizens.</p>

<p>The funds necessary for carrying out this organisation were
to be provided by a tax of two-fifteenths and by revising "the
bookes of taxations for the poore<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>." Besides "for helpe of the
Hospitals and Parishes in this charge all churchwardens and
collectors for the poore be strayghtly charged to execute the
lawe against such as come not to church, against al persons
without exception, and specially against such as while they
ought to be at divine service, doo spend their time and their
money lewdly in haunting of plaies and other idle and wycked
pastimes and exercises."</p>

<p>Some steps were taken to put these orders in execution and
twenty-five occupations were practised in Bridewell. Amongst
these were such trades as the making of gloves, silk lace, pins,
bays, felts and tennis balls, so that some of the workers must
have required considerable skill<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. But on the whole the new
rules suggest the comment "Easier said than done," and so apparently
the City authorities found. The Lord Mayor complains
of the difficulty of keeping order in the City in consequence of
the increase in the number of the poor owing to the erection of
many small houses in Kentish Street just across the boundary
of the City<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. Even in 1594 begging was not entirely abolished.
In that year a new set of orders was drawn up with the object
of repressing vagrants, and it is provided that "no suche poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>people as by reason of age and other infirmitie have been
allowed heretofore to aske and take almes of well-disposed
persons be henceforth so permitted to doe any more but that
the wardes whear they inhabit be forced to maintain them in
some convenient sort without begging or straying<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>."</p>

<p>The measures of London on the whole indicate a good deal
of activity on the part of the City rulers, but until the close of
the period there is little sign of success. In London as elsewhere
it is a period rather of the growth of organisation than
of successful administration. Still the kind of system adopted
throws a great deal of light on the social ideals of the time.
The daily visiting of the poor and the constant watch that
was to be kept over them show that little respect was paid to
individual freedom. On the other hand the orders of 1579
indicate that the municipality endeavoured to carry out the
provisions of the Elizabethan Poor Laws for the employment of
those who wanted work and the relief of all who were in need
of maintenance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. The
organisation
of Norwich.</div>

<p>But the system adopted by Norwich is the most remarkable
of the municipal organisations of the time. As
early as 1565 the Dean and Chapter granted St
Paul's Hospital to the city. This hospital was also
called the "Systers of Normans" and had been used partly as
an alms-house and partly as a house of entertainment for poor
strangers. It was one of the conditions of the grant that the
provision for the poor should be maintained, and after 1565
part of the building was made into a House of Correction for the
poor who would not work<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. The establishment of the Bridewell
by itself was of little good, and we hear that in 1570 the poor
of the city were in a state of great disorder, and that the citizens
contrived to effect an entirely new state of things. So well
did they succeed that the fame of their system was known in
all parts of the country, and the Archbishop of Canterbury
asked for information as to their proceedings. The citizens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>consequently drew up an account of their doings and a "copi
of the wrighting lefte with may L. of Cant. grace the 19 April
1572" is still preserved<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. There the citizens state that in 1570
there were more than two thousand beggars in the city. That
in consequence of this the beggars were demoralised. They
were idle and would not work at all, they became wasteful and
threw away the food given to them, and they also became
drunkards and lived wicked lives, and so were a scandal to the
whole town. Moreover, although beggars were fed, they were
improperly clothed and housed, and consequently contracted
disease and were a centre of physical as well as moral pollution.
Besides, there were no proper means taken to clear the
city of strange beggars, and the number of poor in the city
continually increased. We are told also that the statute (of
1563) was not successful in inducing people to contribute
sufficient alms "upon which occasion was forced to followe compulsion,"
and a collection was therefore made both to restrain
the loiterers and to relieve the poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The condition of affairs here depicted shows that the relief
of the poor was an urgent practical necessity, and that when
the existing law proved insufficient the citizens had no hesitation
in imposing other regulations of their own.</p>

<p>They began by making an elaborate census of all the poor
in the city. They give the name, age, occupation and dwelling
of every man, woman and child of the poorer classes. They
stated whether they received alms or not, and they sent a small
number away from the city or to the House of Correction.
The greater number they classified as "able to work," "not able
to work," and "indifferent." Most of these poor people were
able to work and very few altogether incapable<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>. There were
nearly four hundred men, more than eight hundred women, and
almost a thousand children thus enumerated. The men
belonged to every kind of trade, there were many weavers,
tailors, carpenters and glaziers. The women more often than
not spun white warp. With regard to the children it is
astonishing how often the little boys of seven and eight go to
school<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and sometimes also the little girls. Children of six
are often reported to be "idle<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>." We shall have many other
proofs of the fact that some attention to popular education was
not a creation of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but
that it was fairly general during the days of good Queen Bess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>and the first half of the seventeenth century. Work was however
begun sometimes by very young children, especially by the
girls. For example, Gifferne Potterne a "cordiner and in worke
and Anne his wife that botcheth" had three daughters, the
eldest was nine years old and span, while the others went to
school: two of the youngest workers were two daughters of
Christobell Roll, "the eldiste of the age of seven yeres," these
packed wool. There are many other entries of the same kind
that show that the children began to work when they were nine
or ten or younger still.</p>

<p>After the census had been made the Mayor, John Aldriche,
issued a proclamation forbidding begging altogether in the
streets of Norwich and ordering all strange beggars to depart.
All the poor of the city who could not work were to be relieved
and the others were to be "set on work." A new assessment
was therefore made and the contributions were in many cases
considerably increased<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<p>The poor who were to receive relief were then specified, and
the payments made to them though still small are greater than
they had been before. Other arrangements were also made:
some were sent away from the city; others were placed with
the "select women"; masters were found for the youths, and
inquiries were made to see that servants were hired for the
whole year<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>The Mayor was to be the Master of Bridewell, four aldermen
were appointed commissioners of the poor and all officers
were to be appointed by him. Regulations concerning Bridewell
were made: a bailiff was appointed and twelve incorrigible
idlers were to be kept at work there<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But besides Bridewell in every ward "select" women were
to be appointed, and they were to receive women, maidens or
children "whose parents are not hable to pay for theyr learninge."
These were to be so taught "as labore and learninge
shall be easier than idleness," and the work was to be done
"trewelie and workmanlye" under pain of sharp correction<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.
The deacons were to see after the rest of the poor; to set those
fit to service to serve, to place others with the select women,
to relieve those that wanted help and to see that none begged
or were brought up in idleness<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides all this an orphanage was refounded at St Giles'
where twelve children were to be brought up until they could
maintain themselves.</p>

<p>A little later certain aldermen and commoners were appointed
who presented an elaborate series of orders to the
assembly. These were adopted and a very thorough organisation
was introduced.</p>

<p>Begging was entirely prohibited and every beggar was to
receive six stripes with the whip; the people who gave to
beggars were also to pay the fine ordered by statute and fourpence
for every time besides.</p>

<p>These orders were put in force about May, 1571, and when
they had been adopted about a year the citizens enumerate the
great advantages they had derived from them. "Theis orders
have been attried," they write, and "put in practize in the seyd
Citie and is founde to redowne to theis commodities thereafter
ensuing."</p>

<p>They proceed to enumerate the sums earned by nine hundred
children at sixpence a week; of sixty-four men "which dailie
did begge and lived ydlie and now beinge forced to worke"
earned on an average a shilling a week; and of one hundred and
eighty women who earned twenty pence each a week "one with
another." Strange beggars were sent out of the city, and the
poor were better looked after and no longer had need of collections
for the healing of their miserable diseases. Altogether
the citizens reckoned they saved £2818. 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a year in money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Besides this the most disorderly kinds of people no longer resorted
to the city "and the magistrates trobles for them be
marvellouselye easied."</p>

<p>This organisation of 1570 was essentially a municipal
organisation, but we can see that the statutes considerably
influenced the town rulers of the time. They had tried the
semi-voluntary system of collection authorised by the statute
of 1563, and had found that funds could not be collected in this
manner. They therefore employed more compulsion without
any hesitation. They punished "according to the statute"
people who gave to beggars, and they added a special fine of
their own. The statutes themselves made the organisation for
the collection of funds municipal as well as parochial and it is
interesting to see this double system in working order. The
deacons collected the rates of their particular parishes and paid
the pensions granted to the poor. But it was the Mayor or his
deputies who saw that everyone was assessed at the proper
amount. The payments of a parish did not necessarily meet
the expenses; the rich parishes paid for the poorer ones. The
deacons accounted to the aldermen responsible for the ward;
and some paid to them their surplus while others received the
sums necessary to make up the deficiency<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>Norwich seems to have been the first English town to
prohibit begging altogether; the system of licensed beggars was
still employed in most parts of the country.</p>

<p>The detailed accounts for the poor of Norwich were preserved
down to 1580 and show that the organisation was in full
working order for ten years. One of the compilations relating
to this organisation was begun in 1576 and the whole tone of
this book shows that the citizens of Norwich were very proud of
their doings in matters concerning the poor<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. It is perhaps the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>only place where the purely municipal organisation for the poor
was successful for any length of time. There were difficulties
again in the seventeenth century but as long as the first enthusiasm
continued the system seems to have worked well.</p>

<p>The work was done thoroughly and placed on a sound basis.
The House of Correction and the select women were maintained
by the side of a sufficient collection for the relief and training of
the poor, and, probably for these reasons, the system continued
to be successful as long as the administrators continued to give
it the necessary amount of supervision.</p>

<p>The citizens of Norwich seem to have partially overcome
one of the principal difficulties of a purely municipal organisation
by very rigorous settlement regulations, quite as severe as
any that were ever enforced after the statute of 1662. For
instance a Jane Thornton is to depart because she "in summer
live in the cuntrie but in wint<sup>r</sup> charge the citie," and "Richard
Birch and his familie" were to go to Thorpe though he was not
at this time (1570) in receipt of alms. There are many cases of
the same kind and these continue throughout this period of ten
years and occur again in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>This kind of action with regard to new settlers was not
confined to Norwich but probably extended to all parts of
the country where there was much systematic relief of the
poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. The
action of other
towns.</div>

<p>We will now consider some of the various plans for the
relief and organisation of the poor adopted in other
towns.</p>

<p>We will first see how the municipal authorities
dealt with settlement; we will then investigate various
methods of dealing with the unemployed; and lastly we will
examine the different ways in which funds were collected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. (1) With
regard to the
settlement of
new comers.</div>

<p>With regard to questions concerning the expulsion of new
comers the statute of Charles II. (13 and 14 Car.
II. c. 12) does not appear to initiate a new custom.
Municipal control in this matter begins before
1569. Whenever the town made a vigorous attempt
to maintain its own poor, many efforts were made to
prevent new comers from settling within its borders. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>times
the landlords were forbidden to subdivide tenements or
build more houses of the poorer sort; sometimes the citizens
were fined for entertaining poor inmates, and sometimes the
inmates themselves were ordered to depart.</p>

<p>Thus in London the landlords first are restrained. In a
resolution of the Common Council of 5 Edw. VI. it is stated
that "capytell messuages and houses" had been turned into
alleys and the class of vagabonds was greatly increased. It is
therefore ordered that the inhabitants of these alleys should
pay their rent to the House of the Poor in West Smithfield and
not to their landlords<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>In Aug. 1557 it is not only the landlords but the occupiers
who are to blame, and they are ordered to put out of their
houses "vagaboundes," "masterles men" and "evill disposed
persons," and in future not to receive any one of the sort<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.</p>

<p>The municipal rulers of Ipswich also, in 1557, the year in
which a compulsory Poor Rate was enforced, appointed
"searchers for newcommers into the Towne<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>," and in 1578 provided
that searches shall be made forthwith "for new commers
and servants, retained for less than one yere," and that the
constables are to warn new comers to depart the town<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.</p>

<p>In Cambridge in 1556 an inquiry had been made concerning
new comers but apparently the town rulers were not very
vigilant, for in 1584 the Privy Council ordered them to remove
as many small tenements as might be consistent with the public
convenience<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.</p>

<p>In St Albans as at Norwich we find that the regulations
were very complete. In 1586 monthly searches were instituted:
and the searchers were commanded "in the limits of their
several Wards" to "make search for such new comers to the
town as being poor may be likely to be chargeable to the same,
and if they shall find any such within either of their several
Divisions to give notice thereof to Mr Mayor, that order may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>be taken for their sending away<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>." We hear of orders made
for the expulsion of particular poor people because they were
likely to be in need of relief, and in some cases we can see that
this practice caused great hardship to individuals. Thus John
Tompson, a joiner, had taken a poor woman into his house and
as she was likely to become chargeable she was ordered to quit
the borough<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. Moreover we have the later plan of finding
sureties already in operation. John Palmer was admitted a
freeman, a Thomas Browne undertaking that Palmer's children
should not become chargeable to the Borough<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.</p>

<p>We thus see that the statute of Charles II. did not impose
hardships on the poor never before endured. It is a curious
instance of the adoption by statute of a custom that had long
existed. The custom had been enforced without statutory
authority while the town government continued to possess
semi-independent powers, but it could not be enforced without
statutory authority in later times. The statute therefore
stereotyped a custom that had long been in existence in the
towns and would otherwise have become obsolete.</p>

<p>This practice of preventing settlement has a far closer
connection with the social order of the reign of Elizabeth than
with that of Charles II. It was a great hardship to the poor,
but it was a hardship to which they had long been partially
accustomed and which fitted in with the economic policy of the
towns.</p>

<p>In most towns the right of exercising skilled trades and of
opening shops was denied to any but freemen so that many
difficulties were already imposed on the settlement of new
comers. The organised relief of the poor increased these
difficulties, it is true, but it did not altogether create them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is more interesting to examine the experiments of the
time with regard to the unemployed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. (2) The
action of
towns with
regard to the
unemployed.</div>

<p>In some districts a stock of materials was purchased
either by private charity or by municipal
funds. Portions of these materials were given to
the poor that they might manufacture them. The finished
article was then returned and afterwards sold, while the worker
was paid according to the value of his labour. Sometimes a
master was employed to teach the trade. Thus a Mr Watts
left certain lands to the Mayor and Corporation of Rochester
partly for this purpose. An old parchment roll contains the
rules of the charity. The Mayor was to choose one honest
citizen or several as "Providours of the Poore." The "Providours"
were directed to buy flax and wool "to set the poor to
work." This was to be worked into yarn and the spinners were
to be paid for their labour. The yarn was to be sold in the
open market, if possible, at a profit<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. The same kind of plan
was probably in operation at Canterbury and Colchester. Archbishop
Grindal bequeathed a hundred pounds to Canterbury<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> for
the purpose of providing the needy inhabitants with work, and
Lady Judde left a like sum to Colchester "as a stock to buy
and provide from time to time Wool, Yarn, Flax and such other
merchandize and things as the season should require; for the
setting on work such poor persons, inhabiting within the said
Town, and Liberties of the same, as should be able to work and
labour<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>."</p>

<p>In St Albans we know more of the details of the experiment
and find that there training was provided as well as employment
and the funds were furnished by the town. In 1588 the
town rulers engaged a Dutchman named Anthony Moner to
teach the poor of the town to spin worsted and other yarns<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Eight pounds were taken from the town chest in order to pay
for the looms, combs and wheels which were to be used.
Inquiries were made throughout the town for poor children
who could be spared to learn the new trade; they were to be
taught in six weeks and then paid for their labour<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>. About
the same time terms were arranged for four men to be taught
by the Dutchman. When taught they were to be paid through
"the Company<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>," so that apparently the custom of St Albans
was like that of London; the work of the poor was sold through
the Company representing the citizen workers of the same
occupation. The corporation paid £10 for the original stock of
wool and every two tods were to be paid for when the next were
fetched<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. The undertaking is therefore partly an example of
the employment of the poor by municipal capital and partly an
early instance of technical education provided by town rulers.</p>

<p>Something of the same kind was probably done at York.
In 1578, £400 was raised for "settyng the poor of this citie on
worke," half of which was contributed by the city and half from
the money of Sir William Bowes. In the will of Thomas
Brafferton money was also left for this purpose and more detailed
directions were given as to its use. A stock of wool, flax or
hemp was to be bought and "delivered within the parishe of
Thornabie to be by them wrought and made into cloth and the
poore people for the working thereof to be paid after such rate
as nowe or hereafter shallbe used for such lyke work within the
said parishe<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>." In 1591 proposals were made for the same kind
of undertaking at Lincoln, and a technical school was established
at the expense of the corporation<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. At Leicester also the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>contributed money on several occasions to set the poor people
to work<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. In 1597 the Court of Quarter Sessions in Devonshire
make an order that means for setting the poor to work should
be provided by the local justices as if this were quite a usual
practice<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. There is no reason to suppose that the instances
above quoted are exceptional. There is however more evidence
on the subject during the next period.</p>

<p>But perhaps more often a workhouse or hospital was erected.
At Reading one was built on the site of the house of the Grey
Friars. This hospital contained twenty-one children and
fourteen old persons. The funds were provided by the poor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>box, by private contributions, by collections in the three
parishes, and by the work of the poor. The accounts are in
existence from 1578 to 1648, and the value of the work of the
poor was very considerable. For the fourth quarter of the
year 1578 it amounted to £12. 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>, and this at a time when
the ordinary sum paid for the maintenance of an adult poor
person was about a shilling a week. There were also Poor
Houses at Colchester and at King's Lynn<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.</p>

<p>But the most general arrangement made for the unemployed
poor and for vagrants was the erection of a House of Correction.
The House of Correction before the Civil War was not in all
cases nearly so much like a gaol as it afterwards became.
Often it was also a hospital for the old, and an industrial school
for the young. Christ's Hospital at Ipswich is a good example
of this kind of institution. This hospital was founded in 1569
and was controlled by the town. Governors were elected yearly
who were to meet every week, and a paid official called a guider
was appointed to look after the poor there. In 1594 and in
1597 such guiders were elected and the orders drawn up on
these occasions tell us the nature of their duties. In 1597 for
every person sent to the hospital who was to be forced to work
and "corrected" the guider was to receive fourpence, after that
he had nothing for their keep but their work. But for others
who were sent to Christ's Hospital and were not to be "corrected,"
twelve pence a week was paid, and the value of their
work also. In the orders of 1594 the guider is allowed eightpence
a week for those unable to work, and special provisions
were made about the clothing of the children<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>. It is thus quite
evident that at Ipswich the hospital was used, not only for
vagrants, but also for children and for the impotent; not only
for people who deserved punishment, but also for people who
were simply in need of relief.</p>

<p>In the well-known example of the House of Correction at
Bury the scale of diet and daily routine are specified. There
were two principal meals, dinner and supper, and on days when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>meat was eaten everyone was to have eight ounces of rye bread,
a pint of porridge, a quarter of a pound of meat and a pint of
beer; on the fast days instead of meat one-third of a pound of
cheese or one or two herrings were provided. Those that
behaved well were allowed a little bread and beer in addition,
and those that would not work were limited to bread and beer
only. On the whole the diet compares favourably with that of
a modern workhouse. All were to rise at four in the summer
and five in the winter, and had to work until seven, with
intervals for morning and evening prayer. The amount of
punishment was minutely regulated; the "sturdy rogues"
were to receive twelve stripes, while those guilty a second time
of "unchaste or unchristian speeches or behaviour" received
three<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>Many Houses of Correction were built in the later days of
Queen Elizabeth. The "moste parte" of the hospital of
Reading was to be converted into a House of Correction in
1590 "aswell for the settinge of the poore people to worke,
being able to worke for theire reliefes and for the settinge of
idle persons to worke therein as also for the punishinge and
correctinge of idle and vagrant persons<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>." At York also in
1584, arrangements were made at St Anthony's "for the
punnyshment of such rooges as will not worke<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>."</p>

<p>Bristol, Winchester, Gloucester and Exeter also founded
institutions of the kind, but at Exeter though one was founded
there was some difficulty connected with it, and we are told that
the citizens "afterwards repented<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>."</p>

<p>Thus before 1597 many Houses of Correction were in existence,
and, though according to several authorities they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>allowed to decay for a time, in the next reign they became
general.</p>

<p>But these were not the only methods by which the poor
were set to work. Pressure was put on employers both by
public opinion and by official authority. The Gloucestershire
justices report concerning a disturbance in 1586 and say the
clothiers were not in fault, for "the clothiers here doe yet
contynue to keepe their poore in worke as in former tymes they
have donne althoughe it hath been to their greate losses; and
soe they are contented to doe as longe as they maie occupie
their trade without undooing of themselfs<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>." The fact that this
report was made shows that blame was attached to the employer
who turned off his workmen in bad times; to some
extent the master and not the man was expected to take the
risk of the fluctuations of the markets. In 1591 the Town
Council of Ipswich went further and ordered the clothiers "to
sett the poore on work" within the town, at the same time
providing that, if any refuse the work or misuse their material,
they were to be punished by the bailiffs<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the provision of work for the unemployed was made in
many different ways. Sometimes materials, teachers and implements
were paid for by municipal capital, often workhouses
were established, occasionally pressure was put on employers,
and the most usual plan of all was to establish a House of
Correction, which was used both to punish vagrants and to
relieve the poor. But these attempts to provide work, though
numerous, were not universal and there is some reason to
believe that before 1597 many of these efforts had failed and
needed to be revived in the succeeding years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. (3) Methods
of raising
funds.</div>

<p>The expenses of the organisation for the benefit of the poor
were largely a new charge on the public purse, and
difficulty was frequently experienced in finding
the necessary money. Before 1572 there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>statutory right to make rates for this object, but we have seen
that the borough authorities did enforce compulsory payments
and levied local rates for this and other purposes. The old
methods were continued and new ones tried during the period
from 1569 to 1597. Sometimes the basis employed was that
used for national taxation. The chief direct national taxes
of the time were fifteenths and subsidies. A fifteenth was
nominally a tax on moveables, but after 1334 the total amount
never altered, and each town had to pay an invariable sum<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
which was apportioned from time to time among the local
inhabitants; lists would thus be prepared of how much everyone
had to pay, and these furnished a convenient basis of local
taxation. Probably the earliest compulsory payment for the
poor was the fifteenth levied in 1547 in London, and in 1579
two more fifteenths were imposed there in order to carry out the
organisation of that year<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. At other times fractions of a subsidy
were exacted for local objects. In 1585 in order to meet "the
charge of the poore" at Ipswich the fourth part of a subsidy was
levied "uppon suche as are in the subsidy," while the rest were
to be assessed by a Committee "according to their best discretion<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>."
At Bury also the subsidy book was utilised for this
purpose in 1589 when the House of Correction was founded.
Every person whose land was rated "in the subsedy booke" at
twenty shillings was to pay sixpence in the pound, and every
person "being sett in the subsedye book at 3 <i>li.</i> goods to
paie <span class="smcap">IIII</span><sup>d</sup><a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>."</p>

<p>Another method of collecting money for the poor was by
means of local dues. At Ipswich tolls were exacted from ships
entering the harbour, and payments were also made by all who
were admitted freemen, by all who had "a writing acknowledged,"
and by all who had a witness examined before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>bailiffs in writing<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. Sometimes fines and payments by individuals
for particular privileges were devoted to this purpose.
At Ipswich those who opened shops on Sunday paid their fines
to Christ's Hospital. A parson who had incurred a penalty
by suing for too much tithe was ordered to deliver to the
hospital "60 combes of tanne<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>," and a man of St Albans obtained
a license to keep an alehouse before anyone else on
condition that he paid twopence weekly towards the support
of a certain orphan<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>. Akin to this method of raising money
was the practice of persuading a man to take a town apprentice
in return for the freedom of the town or some other
privilege<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

<p>Soon after the accession of Elizabeth new methods began
to be adopted, and a special scale of payments was fixed where
the poor were concerned. In 1570 at Norwich the citizens
neglected to give according to their ability and so compulsion
had to follow. The basis of the first assessment was the old
voluntary collection. If a new-comer arrived after 1576 he
was taken to the mayor or his deputy and assessed by him at
a suitable sum<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>. In London also we have seen that the first
assessment under the statute of 1572 was based on the payments
formerly made, but the amounts were to be increased
when there was any cause. In Ipswich also by 1579 there was
apparently a special assessment for the poor, for it was then
ordered that "all the persons in this Towne rated to pay to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>the poore, shall presently pay soe much mony as by computation
his rate shall amount unto for one monthe and neverthelesse
continue the paym<sup>ts</sup> of their rates as they are rated<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>."
It seems that in Ipswich the practice of levying poor rates
according to the value of the house was already adopted.</p>

<p>Sometimes a large sum of money was raised at one
time to form what was called a "stock." This fund was
let out at interest to various people or invested in land
and the sums arising from this interest or rent were used
though the capital remained untouched. During the reign of
Elizabeth the various public bodies lent out a good deal of the
money in their hands in this manner. In 1584 there was an
inquiry into the management of funds so raised at Winchester
and the bishop sent a declaration on the subject to the Council.
Some of the money had been used for the poor in the parishes
and some for the House of Correction. A hundred and twenty
pounds had been given for the use of the poor in the parish of
<a name="errata1" id="errata1">Twiford</a>; this had been lent at the rate of ten per cent. and the
£12 so obtained had been or was about to be distributed to
the poor<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. The large sum of £1009 had been spent on the
House of Correction and no proper account was made. In
future, however, the justices were to levy a rate on the parish
so that no parish paid more than fourpence a week and so that
the average amounted to twopence.</p>

<p>Thus we see that during this period all kinds of plans
were tried. There was no attempt to enforce any theory
that the required sum ought to be levied according to the
value of lands occupied or according to the wealth of the
payer. The authorities were sorely puzzled how to raise
the money and adopted any plan that was likely to be
successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. The
events of the
years of scarcity
1594-1597.</div>


<p>We will now consider the events of the years of scarcity
from 1594 to 1597, both so far as they concern the central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Government and so far as they concern local officials. They are
interesting both because of what the authorities
did during these years and because of what they
failed to do. The year from Sept. 1572 to Sept.
1573 was the last in which the average price of
wheat was under 20/- a quarter. From 1594 onwards there
was a succession of bad harvests owing to the excessive amount
of rain. Wheat quadrupled in price, and barley and rye, which
were the grains ordinarily used for the bread of the poor, rose
nearly in the same proportion<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1594, the Privy Council ordered the reissue of the orders
of 1587, and the justices were directed to meet together that
they might devise means of putting them in execution<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. In
1595 further efforts were made to enforce these instructions of
the Government. The justices dwelling near London were
called to the Star Chamber, and an oration was delivered to
them by the Lord Keeper, which had been committed to
him by the Queen herself without any direction from the
Council<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. He stated that the old custom of making an oration
at the beginning of term had been discontinued heretofore,
"but now, considering the presente scarsitye her Ma<sup>tie</sup> of her
own speciall care and regarde to her louinge subiectes hathe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>gyven in charge to us<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>, to delyuer in this place her owne speciall
direction for the redresse hereof." The justices were to overlook
"the certificates in former times made accordinge to some
former orders in that case provided" and were to punish the
offences of "corne maisters and mongers" with great severity.
They were to go to the markets and persuade the farmers to
bring their corn, and if need be "to use there authoritie
therein." They themselves, assisted by all those of the better
sort, were "to make a somme of monie" and therewith to buy
corn to be sold in every market without any profit. Moreover
the justices were to repair to their country homes and maintain
a hospitable house. The Lord Keeper also complained that
there were too many justices, and Her Majesty "therefore like
a good huswyfe looking unto all her houshold stuffe" had
herself marked the names of some who were no longer to
continue in the commission. Those that remained were to look
to the execution of the statute of retainers, to the keeping of
"waches for the punishing of rouges and idle persons," and
"were to exercise Justice with a Herculean courage<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>." At the
same time the Council sent orders to some particular justices.
In 1595 they apparently sent to the justices of Devonshire and
advocated selling corn underprice to the poor: the justices
reply there was no need for such a step for the markets are
well furnished and the price falling<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. But as a bad harvest
again followed the distress became worse. In 1597 the Lord-Lieutenant
also wrote to the Devonshire magistrates commending
the relief of the poor to their especial care, and this
time the Court of Quarter Sessions immediately issue orders
for their relief. The Constables were to "take a view" of all
the poor and of all the wealthy people in the district and to
report the result to the justices. One, two, three or more
people were to have one or two meals given them every day by
each householder. If the householder failed the justices might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>make an order for a payment, not exceeding eighteenpence a
week "for every pole." In addition a special rate was to be imposed
for setting the poor to work<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>. Moreover the Lord Chief
Justice admonished the justices of Wiltshire in 1597 probably
under instructions from the Council. The justices are ordered
to see that the farmers "allowe one bushell in every quarter to be
solde by the pecke and halffe-pecke to the poore at eightepence
the bushell under the ordinarie price of the market<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>"; they
are also to take care that the markets are well supplied with
corn.</p>

<p>The Earl of Bath received letters concerning the high
prices of corn at Barnstaple and "he with other justices came
to town, viewed the market and set the price upon corn there,
to wit wheat 9<i>s.</i>, rye 6<i>s.</i>, barley 5<i>s.</i>, oats 2<i>s.</i>, threatening the
seller with duress if he sold for above that price<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>." Very little
grain was to be had even at high prices, and a Mr Stanbury was
deputed to go to London in order that he might help to
purchase corn for the town. "God speed him well," writes
Wyot, "that he may procure some corn for the inhabitants of
this town in this time of scarcity, that there is but little cometh
to the market and such snatching and catching for that little
and such a cry that the like was never heard." Barnstaple was
not, however, at the end of its troubles<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>; in 1597 wheat was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>sold at 15<i>s.</i> and 20<i>s.</i> the bushel, and many of the inhabitants
must have starved.</p>

<p>The Archbishops of York and Canterbury issued letters to
the bishops of their provinces with directions designed to
mitigate the sufferings of the poor. The usual collections for
their relief were to be carefully made and were to be increased.
The wealthy were "to use a greater moderation than heretofore
in their diet" and were not to lessen the number of their households.
Not only was everyone to fast on Fridays, but they were to
do without their suppers on Wednesdays also, "to the intent that
that which is by forbearance of that meal and at other meals,
by abstinency from all superfluous fare, fruitfully spared, may
presently, especially by the wealthier sort, be charitably converted
to the relief and comfort of the poor and needy." The
ministers and churchwardens were to send monthly certificates
of the observance of these orders with the names of any who
were negligent<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>. We shall see that in Wakefield this Wednesday
fast was observed and it is by no means improbable that
these commands were actually enforced in other places.</p>

<p>The local authorities also endeavoured to remedy the evil.
The proceedings of the Bristol Corporation illustrate the sudden
rise in price and the great need there was for measures of relief.
In 1594 the Mayor, Francis Knight, laid out money "to provide
corn for the common sort of people," and by his means corn was
brought from Danzig to Bristol. One of the aldermen also,
a Mr Thomas Aldworth, spent £1200 in corn and brought a
certain quantity into the market every day. Next year the
scarcity continued, and in November a Mr Whitson was asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>to buy corn for the Corporation. He did so and arranged that
3000 quarters of rye should arrive in May, 1596, and cost 28<i>s.</i>
the quarter. But the Mayor alleged the corn was too dear and
the Corporation would pay but half of Mr Whitson's charges to
London and would only agree to buy half the rye. "But so it
fell out, that when the said rye was arrived in Bristol, it was
well worth 44<i>s.</i> a quarter and more. And then the said
Mayor and Aldermen intreated to have the whole bargain and
would pay Mr Whitson 50<i>li.</i> for his charges and running the
adventure of the bargain, whereupon after some persuasion he
(being of a good nature) consented." The corn was badly
needed and within twenty days was sold at 6<i>s.</i> a bushel, though
even that sum was under the market price. The Corporation
gained £774 on the bargain and many pecks and half-pecks
were given to the poor.</p>

<p>Still this corn lasted but twenty days, and during 1596 and
1597 corn was sold in Bristol at 7<i>s.</i>, 8<i>s.</i>, 12<i>s.</i>, 16<i>s.</i>, and according
to one authority even 20<i>s.</i> a bushel. Under these circumstances
the poor could not live, and it was decided by Mayor
and Council that every alderman or any burgess, that had any
property, should every day give one meal of meat to the poor
people who were out of work. Some were to feed eight persons,
and some only two, according to their ability. "Whereby," says
the chronicler, "the poor of our city were all relieved and kept
from starving or rising." The justices seem to have been
vigilant in other directions also; they would allow no grain
to be exported and ordered that very little malt should be
made<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.</p>

<p>In London the difficulty was great: in 1594 Lord Howard
sent up three ships laden with corn that the inhabitants might
have bread, and in 1596 twenty ships carrying grain arrived
from the Low Countries<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.</p>

<p>This grain may have been used for the whole country. An
old chronicler of Shrewsbury relates that in 1596 "there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>provision made by the bailiffs and aldermen of Shrewsburie
with the commons for corne at London which cam from
Dansicke, Denmark and those foren places to ease all England,
and especially London. There was provided about 3,200
bushels for this town: it came by way of Brestow, and was
sold to the commons after the rate of 8<i>s.</i> the bushell of rie,
which was in the market at 12<i>s.</i> and better: and wheate at
14<i>s.</i> and 15<i>s.</i> Also there was prepared to be baked of the said
rye 40 bushells weeakely by the towne bakers in peny bredd,
two peny, three peny, and foure peny breed for the poore to
have it who were not able to by any bigger portion. They were
so unruly and gredie to have it, that the baylyffs, sixe men and
other officers had mutche adoe to serve them. The God most
mightie send plentie that his chosen flocke perrishe not, and dy
for want as many in all contreis in England die and goe in great
numbers myserably a begginge<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>."</p>

<p>It would appear that this kind of provision was usually
made in large towns, for one of the charges in a complaint
brought against two Newcastle aldermen was that of making
no provision of corn for the poor. The complaint was
addressed to the Privy Council by the discontented burgesses
of the town of Newcastle and could hardly have been made
unless it were generally recognised that it was one of their
duties<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> to provide a store of this kind.</p>

<p>How great the distress in Newcastle was at this time may be
gathered from the bare statements of the town accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sept. 1597. Paide for the charges of buringe 9 poore
folkes who died for wante in the streets, for their graves
making 3<i>s.</i></p>

<p>"Oct. 1597. Paid for the charge of buringe 16 poore folkes
who died for wante in the strettes 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>."</p>

<p>If a few people actually died of starvation many must have
been nearly starved.</p>

<p>All this indicates that the existing organisation for the
relief of the poor could not stand the strain of the continued
distress of these years. There were disturbances and complaints
in many counties and a disposition to lay the blame on
the increase of enclosed land. The Dean of Durham writes that
the poverty of the country arises from decay of tillage owing to
the number of enclosures. The poor this year could neither
pay their landlords nor sow their corn, while many had to travel
sixty miles to buy bread<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>.</p>

<p>There was trouble too in making men obey the orders for
the help of the poor. Some were punished for ingrossing corn
or for converting cottages into tenements<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>, while one man seems
to have been rebellious altogether: "They are knaves ... my
goodes are my nowne," he said, "they nor the queene nor the
Councelle have to doe wi<sup>th</sup> my goodes, I will doe what I liste
w<sup>th</sup> them." The Court of Star Chamber sentenced him to be
fined £100, to be imprisoned, to wear papers, confessing his
fault and "to be bound for his good abearing<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>."</p>

<p>From Dorset and Wilts we hear rumours of discontent<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>in Oxfordshire and Norfolk there were actual insurrections.
The Oxfordshire rebels themselves say that they rose because
of the sufferings of the poor and the high price of corn.
Although Sir William Spencer, one of the gentlemen who had
enclosed land, reported that the rebellion was not begun by the
poorer sort of people, Lord Norris wrote to the Council, "I
want your commission and some order to be taken about
enclosures on the western part of the shire where this stir
began, that the poor may be able to live<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>." It is thus evident
that poverty had something to do with the insurrection. One
of the Norfolk rioters said he had heard that the poor were
up in the west country, and that four or five of his neighbours
would go to a justice of the peace and desire to have corn
cheap; if they could not get it reasonably they would arise and
get it by force, and if they did arise they would knock down the
best first; "they stayed onlye butt for a drum<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>."</p>

<p>A letter from a Somersetshire justice, Mr Edward Hext, to
Cecil gives a vivid picture of the disturbed state of Somerset.
One hundred and eighty-three persons were to be set at liberty
from the Sessions in the year 1596, "And of these very few
came to any good; for none will receive them into service.
And, in truth, work they will not, neither can they without
most extreme pains, by reason their sinews are so benumbed
and stiff through idleness that as their limbs being put to any
hard labour, will grieve them above measure: so as they will
rather hazard their lives, than work. And this I know to be
true: for at such time as our Houses of Correction were up
(which are put down in most parts of England, the more pity)
I sent divers wandering suspicious persons to the House of
Correction: and all in general would beseech me to send them
rather to the gaol. And denying it them some confessed felony
unto me; by which they hazarded their lives; to the end they
would not be sent to the House of Correction, where they
should be forced to work." He estimates that only the fifth
person that commits a felony was brought to trial, for "most
commonly the most simple country man and woman ... are of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>opinion that they would not procure any man's death for all the
goods in the world." He thought the Egyptians were not so
dangerous for there were only thirty or forty in the shire while
there were three or four hundred sturdy rogues<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>. Mr Hext
wrote in a time of famine when the poor were on the verge of
starvation and when the west part of the neighbouring county
of Oxfordshire was in insurrection.</p>

<p>This letter thus confirms the inference we should draw from
the state of Oxfordshire, Norfolk, and Durham that on the
whole the organisation for the relief of the poor was still insufficient.
The public opinion of the time seems to recognise
that there was a close connection between the bands of vagrants
and the recent enclosures. Men like Lord Norris, the Dean of
Durham, and Francis Bacon saw that if the agricultural changes
were ultimately good for everyone, in the meantime they were
bad for the poor; it was clear that many people had been
without sufficient food, and the many insurrections of the time
showed that this condition of things was dangerous to the
peace of the country. The distress of these years thus brought
vividly before men of the time the evils and the danger of the
existing economic condition of the very poor, and the resulting
awakening of public opinion was probably the chief factor in
the creation of the better legislation and more efficient administration
of later years.</p>

<p>A pamphlet written in 1597 by Henry Arth gives us considerable
insight as to the contemporary ideas with regard to
the relief of poverty, and also as to the extent to which the law
was executed at the time<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>. The writer makes a list of the various
classes included under the term "poor"; he uses the word to
include those who require either relief or coercion from the
public. He mentions both "such as are yong and lustie yet
unwilling to labour," and "such as bee overcharged with children
having nothing to maintaine them but their hand labour." It
is in this sense that the word is most frequently used at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>time. Arth goes on to enumerate the causes of poverty, the
sins of the poor and the actions of the "poore makers." The
poor were accused of idleness, wasting their goods in "bibbing
and belly cheare," discontent and "seldome repairing to their
parish churches to heare and learne their duties better." The
sins of the "poore makers" throw more light on the economic
changes of the time. Amongst these are mentioned the "importable
oppression of many landlords," the "unconscionable
extortion of all usurers," the "unsatiable covetousnesse in cornemongers,"
"the discharging of seruants and apprentices," and
the "want of execution of good lawes and statutes." Magistrates
fail to execute the laws, ministers fail to admonish them, and
so "the most do live in disorder." But there are exceptions.
The "strangers" in London "may be a patterne in these
respects to all our English nation," for they keep all their
fellow-countrymen from idleness and begging, and find work
and wages for their unemployed. If any of them become
poor "their state is imparted unto their company, and then
commonly they abstaine one meale on the next Lordes day
and give the price thereof towardes the parties maintenance."
Moreover some well-disposed English people did their duty
in the matter. In some districts a man "shall see not one
begger asking any almes (except one or two that keepe the
common box according to the order) to take the benevolence of
trauellers and strangers so well are the statutes observed in
those places."</p>

<p>Wakefield, where the writer lives, is one of these districts,
"though the poore be many and needy yet thus much I may
speak to my knowledge that if any be pinched with penurie
the default especially resteth in themselves though some other
persons can not be excused. For, (to the prayse of God bee it
spoken) there is not onelie a house of correction according to
the lawe, but withall, certain stockes of money put forth into
honest clothiers' handes who are bounde with good sureties to
set all the poore to worke, after five pence or sixe pence a pound
of wooll spinning (as they shall deserve) if they will fetch it.</p>

<p>"For the impotent poore in every streete, they haue beene
considered of (by the most able and forwarde men of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
towne) and a generall ceassement voluntarie made for their
supplie weekelie, which by confirmation of her Maiesties justices
is still kept of euerie able householder, besides the Wednesdayes
Suppers, for the which the Church-wardens take paynes accordingly,
wherein if euerie one woulde discharge that dutie required
of her Maiestie to let the poore haue the full benefite of their
sayde suppers, there should not one person haue cause to begge
there for all this deare yeare. As for the yonger sort, fitte to
learne trades and occupations there is order taken to put them
to apprentisshippe or otherwise to seruice."</p>

<p>From this pamphlet we see therefore that the law was
sometimes well executed in particular places although as a
rule it was negligently enforced. This view of the matter is
confirmed by the rest of the evidence concerning the period from
1569 to 1597. It is the period of the growth of legislation and
of the machinery of administration, but the working together
of the whole system was also locally successful. At Reading, St
Albans, Norwich, Leicester, York and Ipswich there is abundant
evidence to show that many steps were taken to relieve the poor,
while in Gloucester also we can see that increased action was
taken in this direction, and that the statute of 1572 was more
vigorously enforced than its predecessors. The City controlled
the two hospitals of St Bartholomew and of St Margaret<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
and the corporation yearly elected a president, a treasurer, two
surveyors, two almoners and two scrutineers to look after them.
For certain years the accounts of Governor, Treasurer, Almoner
and Scrutineer of St Bartholomew's still exist<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. Before 1569
the house of the White Friars had been made into a House
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>of Correction. For three parishes the accounts of the collectors
of the poor exist for the years 1572-3 and for five other parishes
for one or more of the succeeding ten years<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>. It would thus
seem that the statute of 1572 was put regularly in execution
in Gloucester and that this was the first statute that was thus
regularly enforced.</p>

<p>There is comparatively little evidence during the period of
the proceedings of justices of the peace in the country, but
we have seen that Mr Sands in Parliament and the justices
themselves in their report to the Privy Council tell us that in
Worcestershire every man was relieved at his own home. We
have also seen that several Houses of Correction had been
established and that their value as part of the organisation
was recognised. It is thus clear that in many places the local
officials were being trained to their duties, and that the statutes
were really put in execution, not completely or everywhere, but
still to some extent and in many places<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>In Parliament legislative experiments were still tried, and
many of the men in Parliament, as justices of the peace or as
members of the Privy Council, were obtaining experience of
the practical working of the law. At the beginning of the
period more stress was laid upon repression than upon relief.
But the events of the years of scarcity brought home to the
minds of most people the weakness occasioned by the partial
execution of the existing system. In most places it could not
stand the strain. The fact that the difficulties of the poor
were partly due to enclosures and not only to the idleness of
the sturdy vagrant was fully recognised. The danger of the
distress of the poor was also apparent: some rose in insurrection,
many others, like the Norfolk peasant, "stayed butt for a
drum," all must have greatly suffered. Consequently the whole
question was re-opened, a statute laying stress on relief was
produced and a more efficient organisation was made possible.
A system of public poor relief could not be suddenly established
in a country like Elizabethan England. It had its basis in the
recognised local custom of parochial collections, and the growing
sense of municipal duty in the matter. Still, but for the development
of the action of the Privy Council, but for the
growing experience of members of Parliament, and but for the
training of local officials and of the general public during these
years, probably the conception, and certainly the execution, of
the act of 1597 would have been impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Characteristics
of the
period.</div>

<p>The years between 1597 and 1644 are in many respects
a unique period in the history of English poor
relief. A great deal of evidence exists, which
seems to indicate, that in many places during
some of these years the whole of the Elizabethan poor law
was put in execution: that is, work was provided for the
unemployed as well as relief for the impotent.</p>

<p>After the Civil War a part only of the system survived.
There are thus grounds for believing that never since the
days of Charles I. have we had either so much provision of
work for the able-bodied or so complete a system of looking
after the more needy classes when they were suffering from
the effects of fire, pestilence and famine. For this reason
alone the history of the poor at this period is especially interesting,
and it is also at this time that the history of the
poor is more directly connected than usual with the history of
the nation as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>We will trace as in the preceding periods the history of
legislation and of the action of the Privy Council. But the
relief of the poor is a matter which can only be efficiently
administered by men who have a great knowledge of detail.
The action of the Privy Council would have had very little
effect unless there had been an efficient system of local government.</p>

<p>We will therefore examine the local machinery of administration
as well as the central and will see what kind of
work was done by judges, justices and overseers in regard
to the relief of the poor. We shall then know who did the
duties with regard to relief now performed by the Local
Government Board, Boards of Guardians, magistrates, and
relieving officers.</p>

<p>We must then regard the system of poor relief from another
point of view and see what kind of relief could be obtained
both in the country and in the towns by the different classes
of poor. This will include the help afforded to the whole of
the poorer population in years of scarcity as well as the means
that were taken in ordinary times to pension the old, to train
and maintain children, and to find work for the unemployed.</p>

<p>Lastly we will endeavour to determine when and where
the administrative machinery was really set in motion and how
far the relief afforded to the different classes of poor was given
all over the country. The answer to these questions will
enable us to see why it is that in England poor laws were not
only made but administered, while in some other countries they
were not administered even after they had been made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Legislation
from 1597
to 1644.</div>

<p>The work accomplished with regard to the poor by Parliament
was unimportant during the period from
1597 to 1644 but some slight changes were made
in the law. It was in 1601 that the statute on
which our system of poor relief has since rested was passed
in its final form. This law, known as the 43 Eliz. c. 2, is often
regarded as inaugurating new methods of dealing with the
poor, but as a matter of fact few important legal enactments
have initiated fewer innovations. It is simply a re-enactment
with very slight alterations of the statute of 1597-8. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
clause of the statute of 1597 which declared all beggars to be
rogues if they asked for anything more than food was omitted
in 1601, while the liability of parents to support their children,
imposed in 1597, was in 1601 extended to grandparents also.
Otherwise the slight differences between the two Acts consist
chiefly of modifications of detail, designed to render certain
doubtful points of law<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>. This statute of 1601 was itself only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>passed as a temporary measure but it was continued by the
Parliaments both of James I. and of Charles I. It remained
by far the most important regulation concerning the relief of
the poor until the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>, and is
in force as the basis of our system of Poor Relief at the
present day.</p>

<p>In comparison with this statute all other legislation of the
period on the subject is of small importance, but several
additions were made to the law, and in four cases these contain
provisions which supplement the system of relief ordered by
the principal enactment of 1601. The first of these concerns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>maimed soldiers and was also passed in 1601<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. The two
former statutes on the subject, 35 Eliz. c. 4, and 39 Eliz. c. 21,
were repealed, but the provisions of both of them were practically
re-enacted. A County Treasurer was to be elected who was to
pay pensions to those who had been wounded or maimed in
the wars. The money was to be raised by a county rate levied
on the parishes as formerly provided, but the amount that
might be so raised was now increased to an average of sixpence
weekly from every parish with a maximum of tenpence from
the most highly rated parishes. Another enactment relating
to the relief of the poor was the 43 Eliz. c. 4. This was likewise
passed in 1601 and substantially re-enacts a statute of
1597 (39 Eliz. c. 6). It provides for inquiries into breaches of
trust by means of writs directed by the Lord Chancellor to the
bishop of the diocese. The list given of the kinds of charity
affected shows how great and varied was the endowed almsgiving
of the time. Some funds had been assigned for "reliefe
of aged impotent and poore people; some for maintenance of
sicke and maymed souldiers and marriners schooles of learninge,
free schooles and schollers in Universities; some for repaire
of bridges, portes, havens, causwaies, churches, sea bankes and
highwaies; some for educacon and prefermente of orphans;
some for or towardes reliefe, stocke or maintenance for howses
of correccon; some for mariages of poore maides; some for
supportacon, ayde and helpe of younge tradesmen, handicraftesmen
and persons decayed; and others for reliefe or redemption
of prisoners or captives and for aide or ease of any poore inhabitants
concerninge paymente of fifteenes, settinge out of
souldiers and other taxes<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>." In both years in which the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>poor laws were passed, in 1597 and in 1601, a statute of this
kind was authorised. The fact indicates that Parliament desired
to maintain and strengthen the older voluntary system of charity
in order that it might work concurrently with the newer
organisation now growing up. A third measure relating to the
relief of the poor was passed in 1603 and provided that a
special rate might be levied for the sustenance of those infected
with plague; the rate in this case was to be levied, not only
from the parish but from the whole of the surrounding
district<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.</p>

<p>But the fourth regulation of this kind is the most important.
It was passed in 1609-10 and concerned the building
of Houses of Correction. The Bill introduced on this subject
in 1597 had been rejected after much dispute and discussion
and in its place the statute "on rogues" had been hastily
passed; this had repealed all the old regulations concerning
Houses of Correction and although it gave the justices the
power of levying a rate for the establishment of such institutions
it had not compelled them to use the power. The law therefore
on this point was much less exacting in its requirements than
that which had previously been in force. The new enactment
of 1609-10 therefore provided that one or more Houses of
Correction must be erected within every county. It is here
laid down that these houses were to be used to set "rogues or
such other idle persons on worke," and no mention is made of
the deserving unemployed<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>. This therefore probably marks
the time when Houses of Correction ceased to be half workhouses
and became very much more like gaols.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus while the law of 1601 is the basis on which relief was
given during the period, additional provision was made during
the next ten years for the assistance of maimed soldiers and of
persons infected with plague, and for the building of Houses of
Correction<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

<p>Before leaving the statutes it is perhaps worth while to
notice the proviso that exists in so many of them in favour
of John Dutton. The lord of Dutton claimed jurisdiction over
the minstrels of Cheshire. In the reign of John, the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Chester was imprisoned by the Welsh in Rhuddlan Castle.
He sent for aid to Roger de Lacy then the Constable of
Cheshire. It was the time of Chester fair. De Lacy collected
a multitude of the shoemakers, fiddlers and loiterers who were
in the town and with this force released the Earl. For this he
obtained a grant for himself and his heirs of jurisdiction over
minstrels and over disorderly characters in Cheshire. In 1216
this privilege was granted by John de Lacy to Hugh Dutton
and remained in the hands of the lords of Dutton through the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was the custom for
the lord of Dutton to hold a Court at Chester on Midsummer
day and in 1498 he received from the whole body of minstrels
four flagons of wine and a lance with fourpence halfpenny from
each of them. A Court of this kind was held as late as 1756<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>.
In nearly all the statutes concerning vagabonds until that of
1822, the rights of John Dutton's heirs were preserved, so that
in the seventeenth century the minstrels of Cheshire, licensed
by the lord of Dutton, might wander without fear of the penalty
inflicted on wanderers elsewhere,&mdash;a curious but direct consequence
of an incident of border warfare in the early part of the
thirteenth century. Few facts illustrate better both the continuity
of English history and the toleration of anomalies by
English law than this perpetuation of the quaint jurisdiction of
the house of Dutton for more than six centuries.</p>

<p>Some of the legal handbooks throw considerable light on
the way in which these statutes were interpreted. In the
seventeenth century "The Countrey Justice" was one of the
most popular of these books. The writer, Michael Dalton,
defines the meaning of the term "poor." Like Arth, he divides
the poor into three kinds, "the poore by impotency and defect,"
the "poore by casualty," and the "thriftlesse poore." This
classification was common at the time and dates back to the
reign of Edward VI. The "poore by impotency and defect"
included the aged and decrepit, the orphan child, lunatic, blind
or lame people, or those who were diseased. The term "poore
by casualty" meant maimed people, householders who had lost
their property owing to loss from "fire, water, robbery or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>suretiship, &amp;c." and poor men "overcharged with children."
Among the "thriftlesse poore" were included "the riotous and
prodigall person that consumeth all with play or drinking,"
dissolute and slothful people, those who wilfully spoil their
work, and vagabonds who will abide in no service or place.
The "poore by impotency" were to be provided with enough
to sustain them properly; the poor by casualty were to be
"holden or set to work by the overseers," and further relieved
according to their need, but the thriftless poor were to go to
the House of Correction. None of these last, he says, are to
have relief from the town for that "were a meanes to nourish
them in their lewdnesse or idlenesse which take it, to rob others
of releefe that want it, to wrong those of their money that pay
it, and to condemn them of oversight which dispose it<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>."</p>

<p>So far the requirements of the law are similar to those of
to-day, but some of Dalton's instructions remind us of the
difference between the Elizabethan poor law and that of our own
time. The poor law was originally part of a paternal system of
government: gentlemen were ordered home to their estates,
farmers were required to bring their corn to market, cloth
manufacturers had to carry on their trade under well-defined
regulations, and merchants were obliged to trade in the manner
which was thought to conduce most to the good order and
to the power of the nation. Workmen also were ordered
to work whether they liked it or not, and, if the law were
enforced, had to accept the wages fixed by the justices. Dalton
therefore goes on to quote another clause of the poor law which
has long fallen into disuse. The overseers were to set to work
"all such persons (maried or unmaried) as having no meanes
to maintaine them, use no ordinary and daily trade of life to
get their living by<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>." If they refused the work appointed
them they were to go to the House of Correction. Moreover
those who refused to work for the wages commonly given
and had not "lawfull meanes to live by" were not to be
sent to the parish where they were legally settled but were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>go to the House of Correction "upon consideration had of both
the statutes of the poore and rogues<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>." Already any man
between twelve and sixty who had not property and was not
a skilled workman might be compelled to serve in husbandry
by anyone who wanted a workman<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. The poor law went a step
farther. Not only might an employer require an unemployed
workman to work for him but the overseers were obliged to
see that he was employed. Occasionally something seems to
have been done to put this clause of the statute into execution.
Thus in a charge given to the overseers of a division in 1623,
these officials were ordered to give the names of those refusing
to work to the justices in order that the offenders might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>sent to the House of Correction. Moreover they were also
commanded "that uppon every Satturday at night or Sunday
morninge they fayle not to enquire and take knowledge what
labour and work they" (the workmen) "are provided of for the
week followinge to the end that if any be unprovided of work
they may [therewith] be supplied by the overseers who for that
purpose are to enquire for worke for them and to provide
materialls for the men that are olde and weake and for the
women and children<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>." In other cases we hear of men being
punished for "living idly," and maintaining themselves "none
knowes howe<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>"; and one of the regular items in the reports
returned to the Book of Orders of 1631 concerned the number
who lived out of service<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. The existence of this part of the
law and its occasional enforcement reminds us that the poor
law once formed part of an economic system entirely different
from our own, in which not only paupers, but everyone had to
do what the government commanded on conditions settled by
authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. The action
of the Privy
Council before
1629.</div>

<p>We will now turn to the administration of the law and we
will first see how this was influenced by the central
government. This action of the central government
is important. In London, in Worcester and
in Norwich we have seen that the local administration was at
one time successful, but it tended to become slack when its
original founders in county or borough were followed by less
vigorous successors. Without steady and continuous pressure
from a central authority on the local officials it seems probable
that in this period, as in the preceding century, the laws concerning
the poor would never have been energetically executed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>in the greater part of England. It is this pressure that was
supplied by the increased activity of the Privy Council.</p>

<p>We will first examine a few instances of the Council's action
before 1629, and we will then trace its policy from 1629 to
1644.</p>

<p>Between 1597 and 1629 the orders in Council and royal
proclamations do not differ greatly from those of the previous
period; they still enforce indirect measures for the relief of the
poor by means of an organisation for supplying the markets
with corn and keeping the price more uniform. After 1597
however the orders which relate also to the ordinary relief of
the poor by means of pensions for the old and work for the
unemployed became of greater relative importance, and during
the crisis of 1622-3 they were much better enforced.</p>

<p>Thus almost immediately after the passing of the poor law
of 1597 efforts are made by the Council to secure its proper
administration. On April 5th, 1598, a letter is sent by the
Council to the High Sheriff and the justices of the peace in
the several counties of England and Wales. The writers do
not doubt that the Judges of the Assize have admonished the
justices that special care must be taken to execute the laws
for the relief of poorer people and maimed soldiers as well as
the laws connected with vagabonds and tillage. "Nevertheless,"
they go on to say, "consideringe the remisseness that
hath bin used generally by the justices of the peace in manie
parts of the realm" they send a letter themselves directly to
the justices and order that care be taken to see the new poor
law "generally put into execution<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>." The writers order the
justices when they meet in Quarter Sessions after Easter to
take "speciall order amongst" themselves "for one strict and
uniform course to be houlden for the due observinge and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>puttinge in execucon of the same lawes and statutes." They
were also to meet from time to time and make the under
officers give an account of their proceedings. This letter shows
the Privy Council enforcing the whole of the ordinary administration
of relief by exactly the same means that had
formerly been used to enforce the measures concerning corn
and vagrants in 1572 and 1586. It is the first time in which
this interference seems primarily dictated by motives of
humanity and not mainly by a desire to maintain order.</p>

<p>Again in 1603 during a time of plague proclamations were
issued ordering the punishment of rogues, and the return of
gentlemen to their homes, in order that they might relieve the
poor by their ordinary hospitality and might take action for
preventing the infection of the plague<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1608 a series of measures concern the supply of grain to
the poor. In 1607 there had been serious disturbances in
Northampton and elsewhere on account of enclosures. The
harvest in 1608 was bad and the Council appear to have feared
further disorder. They were careful to issue a book of orders
containing regulations similar to the orders of 1587 and 1594.
Two proclamations followed. The first commanded the careful
execution of the Book of Orders and the return of gentlemen
to their households<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>; the second prohibited the making of more
malt than was necessary "in order that the poor may have
sufficient store of barley to make bread for their sustenance at
reasonable prices in this time of scarcity of wheat and rye<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>."
In 1608, however, the price of barley was not much affected
and the action of the Council was discontinued.</p>

<p>In 1621 to 1623 the sufferings of the poor were much more
serious, and the measures of the Council concerned both the
supply of corn and the direct relief of the poor.</p>

<p>As early as January 1619/20 a commission was drawn up for
the due execution of the laws for the relief of the poor in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>almost exactly the same terms as that of January 1630/1<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.
Apparently the distress was then due chiefly to the beginning
of a crisis in the cloth trade, for in May 1620 an inquiry was
ordered into the decay of cloth-making in Wiltshire<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. During
the three following years the poverty of the poor increased.</p>

<p>The harvests of 1619 and 1620 had been exceptionally
favourable, those of 1621 and 1622 were unusually bad<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>. In
Somerset four or five hundred people assembled and took corn
from those that carried it to market, and in many other parts
of the country there were similar disturbances<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>The Council adopted the usual methods; the Scarcity Book
of Orders was amended and reissued, and two proclamations
were drawn up ordering the restraint of maltsters and a reduction
in the number of alehouses; the proclamation of
October, 1622, expressly states that this was done because
"barley is in time of scarcitie the bread-corne of the poore<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>."</p>

<p>Besides this the special commands addressed to the country
gentlemen to return home were more emphatic than in former
times, especially at Christmas in 1622. Their presence was
necessary for two reasons. English gentlemen still kept great
households and relieved many by their hospitality, and they
also were expected to maintain order in their districts. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>furnished information to the Government, arranged measures of
relief for the poor and, if necessary, quelled and punished disorder.
James I. had a great idea of their importance: he is credited with
the remark to the effect that a country gentleman in town is
like a ship at sea, which looks very small, while a country gentleman
in the country is like a ship in a river, which looks very
big. In 1622, therefore, two proclamations were issued ordering
gentlemen to return to the country.</p>

<p>In the earlier of these one of the reasons for the regulation is
stated to be because of "inconveniences which of necessity must
ensue by the absence of those out of their countries upon
whose care a great and principall part of the subordinate
government of this realme doth depend<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>." In the second the
king expressed his pleasure that so many had obeyed, and his
displeasure with those who remained in London because he was
"perswaded that by this way of reviving the laudable and
ancient housekeeping of this realme the poore and such as
are most pinched in times of scarcity and want will be much
releeved and comforted<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>."</p>

<p>From a letter written in 1622 we find that the country
gentlemen were by no means pleased at leaving the pleasures
of Court; and "divers lords and personages of qualitie," we are
told, "have made meanes to be dispensed w<sup>th</sup>all for going into
the countrie this Christmas according to the proclamation but
yt will not be graunted, so that they packe away on all sides
for feare of the worst, yet the L. Burghley hath found favor in
regard of his father's age and weakenes<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>." The king was,
however, firm in most cases, and not only issued the second
proclamation in Dec. 22nd, 1622, but by a third in March
1623<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, continued the regulations, so that it is clear this measure
was considered important and was found successful.</p>

<p>But in 1622-3 the orders of the Council do not only provide
for the supply of the markets with corn. The poor were as
much distressed by want of work as by the high price of bread.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>For some years there had been depression in the cloth trade,
partly owing to the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, and
partly to the small amount of coin which was in circulation in
England. In 1622 the Spanish ports also were closed to English
cloth. The merchants and manufacturers found that heavy stocks
were on their hands and ceased to employ the workmen. As in
1527 and in 1586 the lords of the Council tried to remedy the evil
by forcing the employers to find work for their men. In Feb.
1621/22 they sent to the justices of ten of the clothmaking counties.
They say letters have been written to them setting forth
the "decay of cloathing and the great distresse thereby fallen
upon the weavers, spinners and ffullers in divers counties for
want of worke." They recognise that so great a trade cannot
always proceed with equal profit, but upon it the "livelihood of so
many poore workmen and their families dependeth" that they
let the justices know that they have taken a course with the
merchants for the purchase of the cloths in the clothiers' hands,
and "we hereby require yo<sup>u</sup>," they write, "to call before yo<sup>u</sup>
such clothiers as yo<sup>u</sup> shall thinke fitting and to deale effectually
w<sup>th</sup> them for the imployment of such weavers, spinners and
other persons as are now out of worke. Where wee maye not
omitt to let yo<sup>u</sup> know that as wee have imployed o<sup>r</sup> best
endeavo<sup>rs</sup> in favo<sup>r</sup> of the clothiers both for the vent of their
cloth and for moderation in the price of wooll (of w<sup>ch</sup> wee hope
they shall speedily find the effects). Soe may wee not indure
that the cloathiers in that or any other countie should att their
pleasure and w<sup>th</sup>out giving knowledge hereof unto this Board,
dismisse their workefoelkes, who being many in nomber and
most of them of the poorer sort are in such cases likely by their
clamo<sup>rs</sup> to disturbe the quiet and governement of those parts
wherein they live. And if there shalbe found greater numbers
of poore people then the clothiers can reviue and imploy, Wee
thinke it fitt and accordingly require yo<sup>u</sup> to take order for
putting the statute in execution, whereby there is provisione
made in that behalfe by raising of publicke stockes for the
imployment of such in that trade as want worke. Wherein if
any clothier shall after sufficient warning refuse or neglect to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>appeare before yo<sup>u</sup> or otherwise shall obstinately denie to yeeld
to such overtures in this case as shalbe reasonable and iust,
yo<sup>u</sup> shall take good bonds of them for refusing to appeare before
us and immediately certifie their names unto this board."</p>

<p>The Council also say the woolgrowers must sell their wool
at a moderate price, and finish up with the statement of the
general principle on which they act. "This being the rule,"
they say, "by w<sup>ch</sup> both the woolgrower, the cloathier and merchant
must be governed. That whosoever had a part of the
gaine in profitable times since his Ma<sup>ty</sup> happie raigne must now
in the decay of Trade ... beare a part of the publicke losses as
may best conduce to the good of the publicke and the maintenance
of the generall trade<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>."</p>

<p>This high-handed proceeding on the part of the Government
might have been successful if the slackness in trade had been of
very short duration. But in this case the crisis continued, and
the employers were soon in as bad a plight as their men. The
Suffolk justices state that in twelve towns out of two hundred
the manufacturers have lost over £30,000 by bankruptcies, and
in twenty towns only have cloth unsold worth £39,282. The
employers cannot employ the men in clothmaking, but the
justices will do all they can to relieve the industrious poor<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>The reply of the Gloucestershire justices is to much the same
effect: they add that the people begin to steal and many are
starving. The Judges of Assize also say they have interviewed
the clothiers of Gloucestershire, and have persuaded them to
keep on their men for a fortnight: they were utterly unable to
do so for a month<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>. The harvest of 1622 was again a failure
and the distress increased. In December the Council write to
the justices of Suffolk and of Essex concerning some "disquiet
likely to happen ... amongst the poor sort of people who wanting
their usuall employm<sup>t</sup> by reason of the badd vent of new
draperies w<sup>ch</sup> gives them their onely meanes of maintenance
doe beginne to threaten unlawfull and disorderly courses to
gett reliefe." They request the justices to use their best
endeavours to maintain order and say that with "extraordinarie
care" they have taken a course for the relief of those suffering
from extreme need. Early in the year 1623 a series of relief
measures were undertaken, possibly in accordance with the
"course" settled upon by the Council. Special plans of selling
corn to the poor under cost price were adopted, and efforts were
made to find work for the unemployed. We shall examine the
details of these reports later<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>, and will now only notice that
they indicate a great improvement in the execution of the poor
law; they also record a good harvest for the early crops of 1623
and an improvement in trade early in the year<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<p>This crisis of 1622 seems to mark a time of transition in the
action of the Privy Council with regard to the poor. The Orders
in Council were then more numerous and better enforced than
those of any preceding period, though they were only continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>for a short space of time, and seem to have ceased when the
more pressing causes of disorder were removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. The action
of the Privy
Council after
1629 with
regard to the
provision of
corn.</div>

<p>Between 1629 and 1644 the interference of the Council is
not confined to the years of scarcity but is continued
for a long period of time. There are every
year important entries concerning the poor in the
Privy Council Register, and this fact seems to
indicate that the attention of the Privy Council was thoroughly
aroused, and that there was a determination to make the
execution of the poor law a reality. The years 1629 to 1631
like those of 1621 to 1623 were years of high-priced corn and
of a crisis in the cloth trade, and some of these Orders in Council
in 1629-31 are of the same character as those of 1622-3. In
1631 however the interference of the Council is better organised
than before and is continued until the outbreak of the Civil War.
We will first enumerate a few of the measures relating to grain.</p>

<p>The first proceeding of the Government was to forbid the
transportation of corn out of the country. In 1629 and 1631
proclamations were issued to this effect<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>. In 1630 the export
of beer also was forbidden<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>, so as to husband the barley as much
as possible. The restrictions were extended to Ireland, a
survey was ordered of the quantities of grain there, and it
was found that there was a very good harvest. Exportation
to foreign countries was prohibited, licenses already granted
were revoked, and all corn not needed for Ireland was to be
brought to England<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.</p>

<p>At one time, moreover, an attempt was made to limit the
export from county to county and to regulate the supply by
means of licenses. Thus the bakers of London were to have
the right of purchase for twenty miles round the City; Bristol
had special license to buy in other markets and import by sea.
Gloucester, Exeter, and London were allowed to buy in Cornwall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Tewkesbury in Pembroke, Carmarthen and Portsmouth in the
Isle of Wight<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. But this system of licensing proved insufficient,
and in April 1631 the justices of the home counties received
general orders to remember that the transport of corn from
one shire into another was not forbidden<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>. The Government
then recurred to the Books of Orders which were drawn up in
1587, and had been re-enforced in every season of scarcity since
that time. In Sept. 1630 these orders were amended and
reissued by Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>; it is to this Book of Orders that the
corn reports of the justices refer<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. These Orders we have seen
work through the justices, and require justices' reports. In
fact they establish the organisation for the provision of corn
that was afterwards used for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>One other method of the central Government is perhaps
worth noting. Other laws connected with the poor were
enforced, such as those relating to the suppression of beggars
and the labour laws. But these times of famine were especially
the times when inquiries were made about enclosures. The
enclosing of land necessarily excited opposition when there was
not corn enough. There were riots in Northampton and in
other places in 1607-8, and in 1631 "a large number of rebels"
pulled down fences in Braydon Forest<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. A great inquiry was
made into the whole subject in 1609, and in 1631 also the
justices return a few special reports upon enclosures, and sometimes
make their answer a part of the report concerning the
poor. In Appletree, Derby, very little land had been lately
enclosed "for that the greatest parte of this hundred hath been
enclosed long since<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>," but in other cases a few new fences had
been erected<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. There is enough to show that even in 1631
enclosures continued to be made and continued to excite the
old opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Council in 1629-30 endeavoured to minimise the
amount of grain consumed, to secure a proper supply for the
markets, and to see that all laws designed to benefit the poor
were rigorously enforced. These measures are of much the same
character as those of the sixteenth century, but the orders are
much more detailed and much stronger in the parts designed
to secure efficient administration. They were better administered,
and in the reports sent in by the justices we can
see a marked improvement, and signs that the organisation
which broke down in the sixteenth century was successful in
the seventeenth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Action of
the Privy
Council after
1629 with
regard to the
unemployed.</div>

<p>But after 1629 the Orders of Council relate to many other
methods of relieving the poor. Some concern
provision for the unemployed poor, others deal
with the Royal commission and Book of Orders
of 1631, and a few have reference to interference
with wages undertaken by the Government with the object
of relieving distress.</p>

<p>The want of employment in the cloth-making counties
again became a serious difficulty at the beginning of the year
1629. It was partly connected with political troubles; the
merchants refused to pass their goods through the Custom
House in order to avoid paying exactions which they regarded
as illegal. The clothiers therefore could not sell their cloths
or continue to employ their workmen. Pressure on employers
and merchants was a not infrequent way of helping the poor.
The Council sent for the London merchants and thought they
had persuaded them to buy the unsold cloths<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>, but apparently
the merchants drew back; in any case "divers merchant strangers
and denizens" were summoned, and on May 12th they are said
to be "inclined" to buy the "bayes made at Braintree, Bocking,
and Coxall<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>." The privileges possessed by the Merchant Adventurers
for the export of cloth enabled the Council to put
especial pressure on the merchants when cloth was concerned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>The threat had only to be made that the trade would be thrown
open to foreign traders and the London merchants had to
choose between competition from rivals or the loss involved
in buying the stocks in the manufacturers' hands. In 1637
there was again depression in the cloth trade, and again the
Merchant Adventurers were told that the trade would be thrown
open if they did not buy the cloths<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. Moreover one of the
last acts connected with the poor enforced by the personal
government of Charles I. was of the same kind. At the
outbreak of the Civil War the clothing trade was the first to
suffer, clothmakers all over the country petitioned the king
for help, and one of the few resolutions of the Privy Council
entered between 1640 and 1645 was that the cloth trade should
be thrown open to relieve the distress, and free license to
export be allowed at those seaport towns that remained faithful
to the king<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of the
unemployed
cloth-workers.</div>

<p>But this was only one of the methods in which the Council
tried to aid the makers of cloth. Special orders
were sent to the justices of Essex to cause adjoining
parishes to help the districts where cloth was
made, because these parishes were more charged with poor
than the rest of the county<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. Early in May, 1629, directions
were given to the Deputy-Lieutenants as well as to the justices
of Essex and Suffolk commanding them to see all possible
measures were taken to restore order and relieve the poor. It
was especially stated that the clothworkers were to be provided
with work either in their own trade or in some other
good and honest labour, and if that were impossible they were
to be otherwise relieved<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.</p>

<p>Already the difficulty was not confined to the eastern
counties, and on May 17th, 1629, a proclamation was issued
entitled, "A Proclamation commanding the due execution of
the Lawes made for setting the poore on work." The regulations
for "the reliefe of the indigent and impotent poore, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>binding out apprentices, for providing of stockes<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>, and for
setting the poore on worke," were to be "duely and carefully
put in execution." The liability of the parish to provide
funds, and afterwards of the hundred and of the county is recapitulated,
and means are devised by which the duty may be
performed. The "minister, churchwardens and overseers for the
poore" were straightway to meet and take these matters into
their consideration. They were then to report to the justices
of the peace. These latter were to consult together in their
several divisions, and at Quarter Sessions the necessary arrangements
were to be settled. The judges on their circuits were
to find out what had been done and were to make an exact
report. Thus the Central Authority set in motion the whole
local machinery for the execution of the poor law. The proclamation
further ordered that great care should be taken in
those places where there either was or should be any special
occasion "to provide stocks to set the poor on work<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special
commands
again to
Suffolk and
Essex.</div>

<p>Some of the justices seem to have doubted whether they
had legal power to themselves levy a rate for providing
employment for the poor. A few days after
the proclamation therefore a further letter is sent
to the Deputy-Lieutenants and justices of Essex
and Suffolk stating that in their part of the country there was
special need for care in matters concerning the poor, and
therefore the writers again particularly remind them of their
duty and let them know "that it is the resolucon of all the
judges that by the lawe yo<sup>u</sup> have sufficient power and ought to
raise meanes out of the severall parishes if they be of
abilitie, or otherwise in their defect in their severall hundrethes
etc. to sett the poore on worke and to relieve the aged
and impotent not able to worke<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Another crisis of the same kind occurred in 1639 near the
end of the personal government of Charles I. The same
methods are employed; it is the western counties that are
suffering most, and letters are written to the justices of Devon
and of Exeter urging them to make special efforts to remove
the more pressing necessities of the poor ordinarily employed
in the cloth trade<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>

<p>Thus we see that during this period the Council put pressure
on merchants in order that manufacturers might
give their men work; a proclamation was drawn
up by its advice giving strict orders for the relief and employment
of the poor all over the country; and it insisted in several
different ways that in the districts most affected work should
be found and relief given. We can see by the circumstances
of this crisis something of the nature of the difficulty which
the Stuart statesmen had to meet. The social organisation
was based on the assumption that the conditions were fairly
stable; a poor man had the greatest difficulty, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>,
in going from one part of the country to another, and the
apprenticeship laws were fitfully if not rigorously enforced, so
that, if a man's own trade failed, there was little prospect of
employment in another. In our own time a sudden falling off
in trade causes great hardship to the workmen, and in the
seventeenth century the hardship was thus far greater. The
demand for manufactured goods was essentially unstable; the
social organisation was based on an underlying assumption
that work was stable. The introduction of manufactures would
therefore cause peculiar hardship to the poor employed in
them, if exceptional measures of this kind could not be
enforced.</p>

<p>There are several other references in the succeeding years
which refer chiefly or wholly to the action of the Council in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>enforcing provision of work for the unemployed<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>. But after
January 1631, regulations of this kind formed part of the Book
of Orders of that date, and the Register of the Council, so far
as it concerns the poor, relates chiefly to the Royal commission,
then just appointed, or to the enforcement of the Book of Orders
as a whole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. The Royal
commission
and Book of
Orders as a
whole.</div>

<p>As early as June, 1630, a special committee of the Council
itself had been appointed commissioners for the
poor<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>, but in January in the next year a further
step was taken and a commission was issued to
the chief people in the country. The minutes of
a few of its meetings have been preserved, but these relate
mainly to an inquiry into the administration of Mr Kendrick's
charity at Reading<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. Its influence seems to have been very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>considerable, but to have been exerted not so much through
the proceedings of the commission as a whole as through the
appointment of local committees, and through the delegation of
its powers for administrative purposes to various sub-committees.
It had the power to ask for the appointment of local commissions,
and it was in this way that it could most effectively deal
with abuses in any particular district. Thus if there was a
complaint of great distress or if charitable funds were not
properly applied, a local commission was suggested. Such
commissions were granted for Bury, Exeter, Colchester, for
the parishes in and about London, and for Stamford in county
Lincoln<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>, and would be a terror to evildoers in matters of
charitable endowments.</p>

<p>But the commissioners not only delegated their powers by
means of local commissions. For administrative purposes they
divided themselves into groups, each consisting of six or seven
commissioners. One of these sub-committees was attached to
the counties of each circuit. Thus Wentworth was amongst
those especially responsible for the Northern Circuit; Laud and
Coke were assigned to that of Lincoln; Dorchester, Falkland
and Bridgwater to the district round Shropshire; Abbot, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and Wimbledon to Kent; the Earl
of Holland to Norfolk, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
the west country<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>. This division would immensely increase
the administrative usefulness of the commissioners and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>adopted immediately before the issue of the Book of Orders.
It was therefore most probably connected with the system then
established, and designed to enable the commissioners to bring
their influence to bear on the judges, and through them on
every justice in the county.</p>

<p>The Book of Orders was issued in January 1630/1. It is the
most important of the measures connected with the poor
enforced by the Privy Council. It was not the only document
of the kind. We have seen that a Book of Orders for the
prevention of scarcity was issued in the time of Queen Elizabeth,
and was amended and re-issued in the reigns of James and
Charles. This method of issuing a Book of Orders was now
adopted for the relief of the poor at all times and not only in
years of scarcity.</p>

<p>The Orders begin by stating that many excellent laws were
in existence both for the relief of the poor and for the proper
employment of charitable endowments; these for a short time
after the making of the laws were duly executed, and that
in some parts of the kingdom "where some justices of the
peace and other magistrates doe duely and diligently execute
the same, there evidently appeareth great reformation, benefit,
and safety to redound to the Commonwealth." But they also
inform us that in other parts of the realm there was now great
neglect, and that these orders were therefore necessary. The
orders and the directions were given separately; the directions
order the enforcement of the regulations of the statutes such as
those for the repression of beggary, the binding of apprentices,
and the provision of both work and relief. They especially
command energy in the matter within the jurisdictions of lords
and at the Courts leet. Only two of them impose new regulations.
One orders that the Correction houses in all counties
should be made next to the gaol; the other has especial
reference to the time of scarcity; rates were to be raised in
every parish, and contributions were to be given by the richer
parishes to help the poorer ones, "especially from those places
where depopulations have beene, some good contribution to
come for helpe of other parishes."</p>

<p>Eight Orders precede the directions; they prescribe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
method of administration rather than what was to be administered,
and it was this that was most important. The
justices of every shire were to divide themselves so that certain
of them were responsible for particular hundreds. They were
to hold monthly meetings and to meet the constables, churchwardens,
and overseers. From these they were to inquire what
measures they had taken in every parish and to hear who were
the offenders against the laws. The justices were to punish
neglect, and were themselves to report every three months to
the sheriff. The reports were to be sent on to the Judges of
Assize, and from them to the Lords Commissioners, some of
whom, as we have seen, were especially responsible for every
circuit. The Judges of Assize were particularly to inquire
which justices were negligent<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> and to make a report to the
king.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see that these Orders would greatly
help the general administration of the law. Some trouble was
found in executing them, but the Book of Orders formed the
basis of the organisation for the relief of the poor for the years
between 1631 and 1640. In April, 1632, we are told that
much good has been done, but there are now signs of slackness.
All the justices are to do their best and to make certificates to
the judges<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>. In October 1633 the returns had not been so well
made, and the judges were asked to find out what justices were
remiss<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>. In May 1635 a letter was sent to the judges stating
that many times they had received charge to see the Book of
Orders put in execution. Still in most places the justices have
been exceedingly negligent, and the judges are ordered to
insist on their doing their work and returning their certificates<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.
The effect of the Book of Orders we shall be more easily able
to estimate later, but we can see from the entries made in
these minutes of the Council itself how energetically its members
tried to see that their directions were enforced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Many regulations were made about particular places in
time of plague, but to some extent this had been done in the
reign of Elizabeth and it is not a new development in the
policy of the Council. It will be sufficient to notice that
frequent resolutions were passed on the subject, particularly in
1636, 1637, and 1638, and that many of these decisions take
for granted a fairly efficient organisation for the relief of the
poor in ordinary times<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. We shall have to consider these
measures more in detail when we examine the provision made
for the poor in time of sickness.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Interference
of the
Council with
wages.</div>

<p>There are also several examples of the interference of the
Council with wages with the object of relieving the
poor. We have seen that in 1629 the cloth trade
was depressed, and that the Lords of the Council
endeavoured to insist that work and relief should
be provided for the workmen out of employment. At the same
time they also made efforts on behalf of those who were still
employed. In July, 1629, they wrote to the Earl of Warwick
and justices of Essex concerning the weavers of baize in the
neighbourhood of Bocking and Braintree. Wages were already
low, and the men hardly able to live by their labour, yet the
employers were trying to force their workmen to make a
greater length of cloth for the same wages. "Wee thinke it
very fit and just," write the members of the Council, "that
they (the weavers) should receive such payment for their
worke as in reason ought to be given according to the proportion
thereof and also that the said Bayes which are woven
in the saide countie are to be made of one length<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>."</p>

<p>In February, 1631, the weavers of Sudbury complained; a
petition to the Council was presented on behalf of Sylva
Harbert and others, saying the "poore spinsters, weavers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>combers of wooll" were "much abridged of their former and
usuall wages" by the clothiers, "who are now growne rich by
the labours of the said poore people." The matter was referred
to a committee with instructions to cause "orderly payment"
to be made of the "due and accustomed wages.... And in case
any particular person shalbe found either out of the hardnes of
his harte towards the poore or out of private end or humo<sup>r</sup>
refractory to such courses as the said com<sup>rs</sup> shall thinke reasonable
and iust" he shall be ordered to appear before the board<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>.</p>

<p>The employers stated that all of the trade had reduced
wages, but that, if a general rule were made binding on all
the employers, they would be willing to agree to give any
wages which were thought reasonable<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. A rate was fixed by
an Order in Council, but the decision was not obeyed. Lawsuits
were brought by clothier against clothier, until another attempt
was made to settle the matter, and in 1636 Charles I. issued
Letters Patent fixing the length of the reel and ordering that
the wages of all the workpeople should be raised in proportion<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that in 1629 the masters of Braintree
and Booking were trying to take advantage of the competition
of their workmen to force down wages, and that in this particular
trade both then and afterwards the Council tried to
prevent anything of the kind being done.</p>

<p>A bad harvest in 1629, followed by a worse in 1630, plunged
not only the clothworkers but the whole labouring class into
distress. Amongst many other measures calculated to relieve
this scarcity the Council again interfered with wages in order
to aid the whole body of workmen.</p>

<p>Wages had been legally fixed by law in various ways since
the middle of the fourteenth century, and in 1563 it had been
provided that the justices of the peace should every year fix
the scale of wages according to the prices of food, and other
conditions of the workmen. It has been generally considered
that these assessments were either ineffectual or were enforced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>in the interest of the employers and not that of the employed.
But on September 29th, 1630, the Council ordered four letters
to be written, directed to the justices of the peace of Cambridge,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and to the mayor of Norwich, the
contents of which clearly show that in this instance the Council
interfered with the object of helping the poor. The people
themselves had complained that the rates had not been properly
made for them according to law; the Council thereupon write
down to the justices and say that "these hard and necessitus
tymes doe require some better care to be had in that behalfe;
we have therefore thought good at this time to recommend the
same to yo<sup>r</sup> extraordinarie care. For the statutes of 5 Eliz. and
1 Jac. having so carefully provided against these inconveniences,
it were a great shame if for want of due care in such as are
speciallie trusted with the execution of these lawes, the poore
should be pinched in theise times of scarcitie and dearth. And
his Mat<sup>ie</sup> and this Board cannot but be exceeding sensible of
any neglect or omission which may occasion such evill effects,
as are like to ensue thereupon. And therefore since neither
you nor any other can pretend any want of legall power to have
prevented all just cause of complainte in this kinde wee doe
hereby in his Mat<sup>ies</sup> name will and require you to use such care
and diligence that his Mat<sup>ie</sup> and this Board may not be troubled
with any complaint for want of due execution of the aforesaid
statute. And so etc.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>"</p>

<p>The fact that the men complained and that the Council so
promptly interfered in this matter is a strong argument that
both the workmen and the members of the Council believed
that the assessments were enforced, or at least that they had
a great influence on the wages actually paid. The occurrence
certainly shows us that in this instance the assessments were
ordered to be made in the interests not of the masters but of
the men, and that it was the intention of the Government to
protect the men from oppression. It suggests that the justices
were negligent, but it brings into prominence the fact that
the justices were supervised by the Privy Council.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>There is reason for believing that the determination here
shown by the Council to help the poor had considerable weight
in inducing the justices to make the wages assessments of the
time. It was probably an immediate consequence of this letter
that the Norwich justices drew up a new assessment, and
reported the fact to the Council in Dec. 1630<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Moreover a
very large proportion of the other assessments which have
been preserved of the reigns of James and Charles belong to
the years of scarcity, when the relief of the poor was the main
object of the justices<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. As money wages were rising throughout
the century, new assessments were always in favour of the
workman and would become most necessary in times when the
price of food was high; they would also most readily be made
when the necessities of the poor were great.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth while to notice one other instance of protection
given to workmen by the Privy Council. During another
time of trade depression, in the year 1637, Thomas Reignolds,
manufacturer, made his workmen accept cloth instead of money
for their wages. The men complained; the Council found it was
a second offence and ordered Thomas Reignolds to be sent to the
Fleet until he had paid his workmen double the amount they
had lost, and their charges for bringing the complaint besides<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.
The punishment for truck inflicted by the Privy Council during
the personal government of Charles I. was certainly severe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. Summary.</div>

<p>Thus in the period from 1597 to 1644 the Privy Council
are increasingly active on behalf of the poor, and
during eleven of these years, from 1629 to 1640,
they adopt a policy of constantly exerting influence to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>the proper administration of the poor laws. This continuous
policy seems to be suggested by the exceptional measures
which had formerly been adopted in years of scarcity. In every
season of high-price corn since 1527 some action of this kind
was taken, and every exceptionally bad time of distress increased
the extent of governmental interference. The continuous
policy adopted between 1629 and 1640 began with
a failure of harvest and crisis in the cloth trade, and the
earlier methods of the Government were like those of 1597
and 1622. But while the season of scarcity still continued
the Privy Council issued the Book of Orders for the relief of
the poor, and the organisation begun by these commands was
continued throughout the period of personal government.</p>

<p>Abbot and Laud, Wentworth and Falkland, Dorchester and
Wimbledon are the members of the Privy Council whose names
are most closely connected with this policy. Its effects and
success we shall be better able to estimate later, but we can
already see that the system which the Privy Council tried to
enforce was considerably more extensive than any organisation
of poor relief with which we are familiar. Already we know that
the poor were not only looked after in times of bad harvests, as
in the sixteenth century, but they were also sometimes employed
when they were out of work, and that, not only when an individual
was unfortunate, but when whole classes were suffering
from a fluctuation in trade. This certainly could not always be
carried out, but the Council insisted that it should be attempted.
The personal government of Charles I. has been more associated
with the exaction of Ship Money than with attempts to enforce
a system which has much in common with the socialistic
schemes with which we are familiar on paper, and yet these
eleven years are remarkable for more continuous efforts to
enforce socialistic measures than has been made by the central
Government of any other great European country. Apart from
its success or failure the attempt is interesting, because it shows
us the ideal of government which was in the minds of Charles I.
and his advisers, and reminds us that these infringers of individual
liberties were also, in intention at least, the protectors
of the poor.</p>

</ul>

<p>The increased activity of the Privy Council, which made the
poor law of the seventeenth century more effective than that of
the sixteenth, depended for its success upon the activity of the
local officials, particularly of the justices of the peace and the
municipal authorities. We will now therefore examine the work
done (1) by the justices and town rulers, (2) by the judges<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>, and
(3) by the overseers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Powers
of the
justices.</div>

<p>We have seen, in the Elizabethan organisation of Norwich,
how much the justices and municipal officers could
do when they were at their best, but preambles,
proclamations, and letters of the Privy Council
combine to tell us that continuous vigour and energy were
exceptional. Still the important point is that this local govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>ment
existed, and under pressure could become effective. It was
because the organisation was there that the letters of the Privy
Council were so important; if the justices had been powerless
officials, Privy Council letters would have been useless. It
is because the justices had the power and could be effective,
that it is necessary for us to see how far the Privy Council
measures stirred them into action.</p>

<p>The Chancellor's charge in 1608 to the justices and judges
throws some light on the social position and importance of the
justices, and also shows that the Government thought it very
necessary that their work should be well done. The Chancellor
complained that the justices who did the work could have no
place on the bench, and could hardly get into the court "for the
number of newe and younge knightes, that come in there
braueryes and stande there lyke an Idoll to be gazed vpon
and doe nothinge, ys so greate and pressinge for place countenaunce
and estimacyon." These young justices are reminded
that "they are not Justices for their countenaunce onelye."
They and the other justices are exhorted to "remember there
oathes and dutyes that they are for the Justice, peace and
gouernemente of the cuntrye." They were especially commanded
to prevent vagrants from wandering; to see that the
proclamation and letters "for corne busynes" were enforced,
and that "y<sup>e</sup> poore be prouyded for w<sup>th</sup>in there paryshes." They
were also told that it was their duty to prevent all riotous
assemblies at the beginning, and that if there were disturbances
they would be held responsible<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. This speech shows us that the
Government thought the peace of the country depended mainly
upon the vigilance of the justices, and that the office of justice
of the peace was much coveted because of the influence and
respect it gave its possessor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powers of
the justices
under the
Statutes.</div>

<p>Under the provisions of the poor laws the justices had some
duties for the performance of which they were
directly responsible, and others in which they had
to supervise the overseers and the constables. They
were directly responsible for the relief of maimed soldiers, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>maintenance of Houses of Correction and for contributions to
prisoners and to such county hospitals as were in existence.
They were further the authorities who made the special assessments
in time of plague and levied the rates in aid of poorer
parishes. To them were also referred questions of settlement
and other matters which concerned several parishes. Moreover,
although the overseers were primarily responsible for setting
the able-bodied poor to work, the justices sometimes levied
county rates for this purpose, and occasionally ordered that
particular people should be relieved from county funds.</p>

<p>But the hardest part of their duty in this matter consisted
in the proper supervision of the overseers. The names of the
poor of each parish had to be presented to them, and the assessments
sanctioned by them; it was their duty to examine the overseers'
accounts and to see that the pauper children were bound
apprentices. Moreover, they had to punish negligent officials,
to coerce unwilling contributors, and to listen to the appeals of
aggrieved persons, whether they were injured ratepayers or unrelieved
poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Work of
justices in
first putting
the law in
execution.</div>

<div class="sidenote">(<i>a</i>) In the
West Riding
in 1598.</div>

<p>The orders of the West Riding Sessions Rolls during 1598<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
give us some idea of the difficulties of the
justices in putting the system into execution.
The statute of 1597-8 was apparently the first
regulation of the kind generally administered in
the West Riding, but efforts were made to enforce
this as soon as it came into operation<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>. In June 1598 elaborate
orders were drawn up for the division of Knaresborough, which
show us that the new methods met with considerable opposition.
The churchwardens and overseers presented the names of the
poor, but they said that all the parishes objected to pay money.
The inhabitants preferred to give "releefe" to beggars, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>some, they said, could help in this way who could not afford to
pay rates. The justices allowed the parishioners to have their
own way to some extent. They stipulated, however, that the poor
should ask relief of their fellow parishioners only, and that those
who were able to work should be set to work. Moreover, the
occupiers who lived out of the parish and the inhabitants who
refused to give sufficiently were to be assessed<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>. It was not
only in Knaresborough that poor rates were unpopular. Seven
inhabitants of Tickhill refused to give the sum assessed on
them<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>, while in Bentley and <a name="errata2" id="errata2">Arkesey</a> an assessment was duly
made, but the money was not paid until the goods of many of
the inhabitants had been distrained<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.</p>

<p>This enforcement of local responsibility at first increased
rather than lessened the hardships endured by many of the
poor. We are told that "divers personnes are nowe sent forth
of all partes of this realme to the places of their births; wherof
some of those personnes so sent have bene inhabitinge and
dwellinge in those places and townes from whence they are sent
by the space of twentie yeares, some more, some lesse."</p>

<p>This was done by the parochial officials in order that their
own parish might not be forced to support these poor
people. They endeavoured to shift the burden to the parish
where the people were born, or to get them sent as rogues
to the House of Correction, where they would be supported
by the county. The justices of the West Riding tried to
prevent this unjust practice. No poor of the Knaresborough
division were to be sent to the place of their birth without
special order from some neighbouring justice of the peace.
Moreover, the testimonials of the poor passing through the
division were to be examined, and when the bearers were found
to have lived more than three years in the parish from which
they were sent they were to return again. "For," say the
justices, "such kynde of personnes ... are not rooges nor wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>inge
beggers within the meanyng of the statute, but ought to
be releived as the poore of the parishe wher they so inhabited
and wher they wrought when they were able to worke<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>."</p>

<p>The refusal of the inhabitants to pay rates and this illegal
way in which the parochial authorities attempted to get rid of
the poor they were now forced to maintain indicates that the
first enforcement of the new poor law caused considerable dissatisfaction<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>.
These difficulties bear out the conclusion that no
earlier poor law had been adequately put in force in this district.
Now, however, the justices insisted that more should be done,
and occasionally they seem to have been successful<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. (<i>b</i>) Work
of the justices
in first putting
the poor law
in execution
in the North
Riding.</div>

<p>The North Riding Records begin in 1605 and disclose a
somewhat similar state of things. The system of
compulsory poor relief is evidently more generally
in operation. Vigilance in enforcing laws designed
to prevent the growth of a poor population is one
of the signs that the poor rates in a district are
high, and in the North Riding much care was taken to prevent
the building of cottages without four acres of land, and to
punish landlords who took in lodgers<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. Moreover, maimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>soldiers received pensions, the county hospitals were supported
and many orders were made for the relief of particular poor
people<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>. A House of Correction was also built, though not
until 1619, after many resolutions had been passed on the
subject<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>. On the other hand, there is also evidence that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>organisation did not yet work smoothly. Overseers are constantly
presented for neglecting their duties, ratepayers for not
paying their rates; sometimes even all the overseers of a parish
are presented for not making "cessments," or for not relieving
the poor<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>, and in one case not only did the overseer neglect
to obey the justices' order for the relief of a particular poor
man, but the constable refused to obey the warrant for the
apprehension of the overseer<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>. If the justices' difficulties in
Yorkshire are typical of their difficulties elsewhere, it is not
surprising that some of them were negligent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Reports of
the justices in
response to
the Book of
Orders.</div>

<p>Between 1629 and 1631 there was a new development in
consequence of the frequent orders on behalf of the poor of those
years. In each period of scarcity the justices had been told
to allot themselves to particular divisions for the purpose of
carrying out the special orders sent by the Privy
Council. The Book of Orders of January 1630/1
made this a permanent arrangement so far as the
relief of the poor was concerned<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>. The justices
of each particular division were to meet monthly and examine
the overseers and constables so as to see that their duties
with regard to the destitute were properly fulfilled.</p>

<p>Not only were these orders made but we have evidence that
they were executed. The proclamation of 1629 and the Book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>of Orders of 1630/1 direct reports of the justices' proceedings to
be sent to the Council. About a thousand reports dealing with
the ordinary relief of the poor were received and are preserved
among the State Papers. A few of them relate to the proclamation
of 1629 or to other special letters or inquiries, but the
majority are reports as to the execution of the Book of Orders
of 1630/1. Moreover, three hundred other documents concern
efforts to provide corn at reasonable prices for the poor. These
latter begin to arrive in October, 1630, and are numerous in
December. The series of reports on ordinary poor relief are
exceptional in 1630, but were received frequently in April and
May, 1631. Both series of reports were returned until 1633;
after that date there are few corn reports, but those dealing
with the poor continue until 1639, when both cease altogether<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.
A proclamation is issued in 1640, and, like that of 1629, orders
the execution of the poor laws and the provision of stocks for
the employment of the poor; it also orders special inquiry by
the judges as to how far these orders were executed, and as to
how far they were successful<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. But there are no more reports,
and it seems most probable that no more were sent. These
documents thus relate to the years 1630 to 1639, that is to the
greater part of the period of the personal government of
Charles I. They exist in consequence of the action of the
Privy Council and form the chief evidence as to how far that
action was effectual.</p>

<p>The details of these returns will have to be considered in
every part of our subject, and especially when we come to
discuss the relief given to the able-bodied poor. We will now
only examine their general character, partly in order that we
may see what sort of work was done by the justices acting
under the special instructions of the Privy Council, and partly
that we may understand the kind of evidence which is furnished
by these documents. We have seen that the orders
issued by the Privy Council to the justices concerning the poor
were similar in form to those that had previously been issued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>concerning corn. The reports sent in answer to them are also
similar to the corn reports of 1587. They are sometimes
addressed to the Sheriff, often to the judges of Assize, and
occasionally directly to the Lords Commissioners or Lords of
the Privy Council<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>. The justices adopt many different methods
in making their returns. Occasionally they enclose the reports
of the overseers, or give a full abstract of them<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>. But more
usually the justices only state the general nature of their
doings, occasionally inserting details about particular assessments,
workhouses, or fresh methods of employing their poor.
Incidentally they frequently give us information as to the state
of trade, the number of recusants, the population, weights and
measures, and the difficulties in the way of administration<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>.</p>

<p>There are one or two cases in which they give the minutes
of their meetings. One of these is sent by the justices of the
Alton division of Hampshire and will give us an idea of how
these special meetings were conducted. The Sheriff sent a
letter and the Orders to these justices on February 10th, 1631.
They held their first meeting on March 12th, and three others
before May 1st, so that they seem very anxious to set things in
order<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.</p>

<p>On March 12th from <a name="errata3" id="errata3">Fropfield</a> John Godden was presented
for "being drunk on the Sabbath day," John Roake "for liveing
idlye," and four others for "useinge unlawfull games in tyme of
eveninge prayer." Five children were also placed apprentices.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>From Petersfield there were three cases of a man being accused
of "liveinge idly and mainteyninge himself none knowes howe."
Warrants were sent for some others for "teareinge of hedges."
Six were fined a shilling each "for beinge absent from diuine
service," and John Aylenge paid eighteenpence as he was
suspected of being drunk. Richard Wolgatt was presented
for keeping "a common alehouse w<sup>th</sup>out lycence but noe
process beinge made to convict him; yt was prohibited." The
children fit for service of this place also were placed apprentices.
Similar cases were settled for the other places at the other
meetings. But the most important part of the proceedings for
our purpose is the presentment of the constables and churchwardens.
The constables and tithingmen stated what rogues
had been punished in every tithing, "the churchwardens and
overseers of the poore made presentm<sup>t</sup> of the nomber of
theire impotent poore in theire severall parishes, the nomber
of theire able poore and howe they are releived and the other
sett to worke and of all other thinges concerninge theire office."
At the fourth meeting, held on April 30th at Petersfield, the
accounts of the churchwardens and overseers were taken and
new overseers appointed for the next year. Moreover, besides
all this "articles in writing" were given to the constables, tithingmen
and overseers of which they were to give an exact account
at the next meeting.</p>

<p>The report for the town of Cambridge gives perhaps even
a better idea of the work done by the justices but no details
of cases. As we shall have to refer so often to these justices'
reports, it is worth while to quote this one in full in order that
we may have a clear idea of what these documents were like.</p>

<p>As the main part of our evidence depends on the justices'
reports we must determine whether the methods described
in these returns are typical of those employed all over the
country or whether we have reports only from the more
energetic justices. Now we hear of some instances of finding
work for the unemployed from other sources<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>. If we possessed
all the most favourable cases in our reports all or most of these
instances would be found amongst them. But this is not the
fact; some are reported and some are not. It is clear then
energetic administration of the law existed which was not
mentioned in the reports now preserved amongst the State
Papers. We may therefore conclude that the reports do not
come only from vigorous administrators but are fairly typical of
the whole country.</p>

<p>The minutes of the meetings at Alton and the report of
the justices of Cambridge give us a good idea of the effect of
the Orders and Directions on the justices. In the first place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>they show us that a number of meetings were held in consequence
of the Book of Orders. In some cases these meetings
seem to have taken place every month throughout the period
from 1631 to 1639<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>; but from a report of Lord Fairfax it
appears that special inquiries into the requirements of the Book
of Orders were made only once a year in his part of Yorkshire<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>.
The meetings, even if they were only infrequent, must have
had a considerable influence in improving the execution of the
poor laws.</p>

<p>On these occasions a number of offences were punished.
Some were connected with the relief of the poor because the fines
exacted were used for that purpose. Among these were such
faults as playing at unlawful games, getting drunk, swearing,
the "profanacon of the Saboth," and not going to church<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.
Other cases related to breaches of the vagrancy laws and of that
part of the poor law which placed upon the overseers the duty
of seeing that all who had not any means were set to work<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.</p>

<p>But the presentment of offenders was only a part of the
duties to the poor discharged at the meetings. Arrangements
were made for binding children apprentice, and pressure was
exercised on the subordinate poor law officials to properly
perform their duties. The justices found out how many poor
were relieved and what each received, and they inquired
whether there was a stock for their employment<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. They also,
when necessary, urged the increase of rates, the raising of
a new fund, or the provision of stores of corn to be sold to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>the poor at lower prices. The whole system shows how much
of the social side of government depended upon the justices,
and may perhaps induce us to sympathise with the complaint
of the gentlemen of Nottingham that they have "little rest
either att home or abroade<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 <i>a</i>. The
work of the
judges. Authoritative
decisions on
points of law.</div>

<p>The judges also were concerned in the administration of
the system of poor relief partly in the ordinary
course of their duties, and partly in consequence
of the special action of the Privy Council. It was
the custom of the time to obtain interpretations
of law from the judges in reply to general questions
and not only through the decision of particular cases. These
interpretations were given not only in such cases as the
imprisonment of Members of Parliament, but also in matters
affecting the poor law. A long list of resolutions was arrived
at on the statute of 1597-8 concerning the interpretation of
that statute<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>. Other questions arose later, and were decided in
the same way. Thus in 1620 there was a dispute in the town
of Lydd which led to the seizure of the bailiff's cattle and his
retirement from the magisterial Bench of his ungrateful town<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.
The query is submitted as to the legality of a tax for the poor
which was levied on the inhabitants of a parish for their lands
and goods in gross, and on the farmers for their land per acre.
Sir Robert Houghton and Sir Ranulph Carew decided in its
favour, and the paper is endorsed "The question of taxing for
the poor of Lydd decyded by the Judges of Assize<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>." We have
already seen that the Council told the justices of Suffolk that
it was the resolution of all the judges that they themselves
might levy a tax to employ the poor<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>, and in 1633 also many
decisions on points of law were issued as the resolutions of the
judges of assize<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">4 <i>b</i>. Administrative
work as the
link between
the Privy
Council and
the justices.</div>

<p>But the duties of the judges of assize under the orders of
the Privy Council were much more important.
They had to act as the link between the central
government and the county and municipal officials.
They were particularly ordered to let the Council
know which justices did their duty<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>, and many of
the reports were sent in to them. In March 1630 we hear
that in Suffolk malting was prohibited in the interest of the
poor by the judges of assize in order to increase the supply of
barley<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>; a little earlier the Norwich authorities had great
difficulty in controlling the maltsters, but stated that with the
approbation of the judges they had arranged that no alehouse
should be licensed but such as entered into a recognisance by
sureties to sell two "thurdendeles" of beer for a penny<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. The
work done by the judges is indicated by one or two references
of this kind<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>, and since some of the later orders of the Privy
Council were especially directed to them it seems probable
that they had a great deal of influence in enforcing the orders
of the Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">5 <i>a</i>. The
work of the
overseers in
1599.</div>

<p>The last authority who was responsible for the execution of
the poor law was the overseer. He it was who
had to do the work, the function of all the others
was to make him do it. It was the duty of the
overseers to know all about the poor in their
parish; to fix the amount of the assessment and to levy it
proportionately. They had also to provide pensions and habitations
for the impotent poor, to find masters for apprentices
and to procure work for the unemployed. The overseers'
accounts for Staplegrove in the county of Somerset in the year
1599 will show us something of their ordinary work. Payments
were made by twenty-two parishioners quarterly and by sixteen
weekly, while two of the inhabitants took charge of two impotent
people. Ten poor people received payment of a small sum every
week on what we should now call the outdoor relief system.
Besides this money had been disbursed in order to provide for a
pauper's burial, to recompense tithingmen for receiving the poor
strangers that were brought to them, and to purchase clothes
and wood for the older poor and also outfits for apprentices<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>.
In this account there is nothing about setting the poor to
work, but the rest of the poor law seems to have been well
executed in 1599.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 <i>b</i>. When
stirred to
greater activity
by
scarcity
measures.</div>

<p>The kind of instruction given to the overseers when the
justices were stirred to greater activity than usual
may be gathered from a paper in the Tanner
Manuscripts. It is entitled "A true copy of the
charge given to the overseers of every towne the
19 of December 1623," and must refer to some
particular county or some particular division. During the
early part of this year the price of corn was high and the
justices took many measures to provide for the poor. The
sufferings of the poor in the preceding winter may be the
reason that the justices were more strict in their supervision
at this time. There are altogether eight orders, one of which
relates to alehouses; the constables and overseers are ordered
to see that the labourers and other poor are well served with
bread and beer, and that they do not linger longer than is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>necessary for the delivery of the bread and beer. Another order
shows how very inquisitorial was the character of the Government
of the time: there was certainly no notion that the
Englishman's house was his castle. The overseers and one of
the constables were twice every week to search the houses
of the labourers at night to see that all were at home, and
also to look out for any articles that the people might be
suspected of stealing. Several of the orders concern the
keeping of the poor at work<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. Others arrange that children, not
yet old enough to be apprentices, should be taught to spin by
some honest woman in the town, who was to have a penny a
week for each child until it could earn something for itself.
Beggars were to be punished, and provision of fuel was to be
made for the poor<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>. We can see how far removed this system
was from our own notions of liberty, and we can also see
that if the overseers performed these orders, they had even
more reason than the justices to complain of hard work. There
is a great deal about the provision of work and comparatively
little about pensions, so that here it seems likely that the
overseers were more likely to provide for the impotent without
pressure than to find work for the unemployed. During the
years 1631 to 1640 we are often told that "articles" were
delivered to the overseers, and this document is not improbably
typical of some of them. For these are the kind of matters
commented on by the justices whenever they enter into details
at all<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 <i>c</i>. After
the issue of
the Book of
Orders.</div>

<p>We have seen that in a few of the justices' returns the
reports of the overseers were enclosed. The justices
of the Liberty of St Alban's sent their answers in
this manner. They were responsible for the
parishes of Chipping Barnet, East Barnet, Elstree
and Northaw. In 1637 they still held monthly meetings, and
the overseers' accounts returned at them will give us some
idea of the work often done by overseers when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>supervised in the special manner ordered in 1631 and continued
until 1640. At the January meeting of 1637 the justices gave
"charge that the presentments should be better and more
fully certified<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>"; at the February meeting, therefore, fairly
detailed reports were returned from three of the four parishes<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.
At Chipping Barnet we hear they have no Popish recusants
or non-churchgoers. They have not put forth any apprentice
during the month, but are about to bind a certain
fatherless child. One of the magistrates undertook to see the
boy was bound before the next meeting. One family had
apparently been stricken with plague, and had been paid eight
shillings before they were shut up; eight weekly pensions were
paid to impotent people, one to a "Mad Tib," and two people
receive payments for taking care of children. The report also
states that "we have in towe and yarne and cloath xx<sup>s</sup> and in
money to buy more xx<sup>s</sup>." From this account it is clear that
the poor were actually set to work in Chipping Barnet and that
not all the funds available for the purpose were utilised. From
Northaw the constables only report, but their return concerns
poor relief as well as vagrants. They say all the impotent
poor are relieved while the poor that can work are "sett on
work and doe not refuse the same." In this virtuous parish
also none disorder themselves with drinking or frequent alehouses
during divine service on the Lord's day and no idlers
could be found though the constables had diligently searched
for them. From Elstree we have an account of the pensions
paid to certain poor people, and we have also the statements
that "we have in stocke for the poore remayning forty shillings,"
and "we set such on worke as want uppon euery occasion."
East Barnet makes no return, and a warrant is sent for the
overseers to answer the contempt. On April 9th, 1639, they
send a report, and then relieve only one impotent person, but
have eight pounds in hand for setting the poor to work<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.</p>

<p>If therefore we may take these reports as specimens of
rural parishes, we see that in each parish a stock existed for
setting the poor to work, and that there does not seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>been any great difficulty about the unemployed. The relief of
the impotent and the apprenticing of children appear to have
been carefully looked after, and the justices were prompt to
notice any omission in the reports. We shall see later that
there is reason to believe that these parishes were not exceptional,
but that under the supervision of the justices the
same kind of measures were taken in many parts of southern
England.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the central government, the
Privy Council, energetically tried to enforce the law, and that
this increased energy makes the seventeenth century the important
period in England for the poor law administration.
We now see that in justices, judges and overseers the local
government existed through which the action of the Privy
Council could be made effectual. It is in this that England
differed from other European countries, particularly from
France and Scotland. We have drawn our information chiefly
from the official records of Privy Council, justices or overseers.
We have noted examples in the work of the justices and overseers
in which the action of the Privy Council did have a
considerable effect. We have also seen that a large body of
evidence exists which will give us much information as to the
methods of relief employed, and may enable us to tell how far
the system was successful. We have now to see how this
organisation affected the poor, and how far it was generally
enforced in all parts of the country.</p>

<p>We will therefore cease to examine the system from the
point of view of the administrative machinery, and instead
consider, first, the relief which it afforded the various classes of
poor, and secondly, the extent to which the organisation, whose
nature we have described, was employed over the whole country.</p>

<p>The special emergencies in which the poor most often obtained
relief in the seventeenth century were those arising
from bad harvests, sickness, and fire.</p>

<p>We will first examine the methods of supplying the poor
with corn after bad harvests. We have already seen that in
1608, 1621-3, and 1629-31 the central government issued
orders with this object, which closely resembled the commands
which had been issued during the reign of Elizabeth. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have now to see how these orders were executed in the early
part of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1608 there is little evidence in this direction. A report
however was sent from Colchester. There, the constables took
an account of the number of persons that had corn by them;
of the bargains they had made and of the number of acres
they had sown, and in accordance with that survey every
person was ordered to bring weekly to market so many bushels
of corn unless they had already sold them to poor artificers
and day labourers<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. There were probably like reports from
other places but there is nothing to make us think that the
scarcity Book of Orders was better executed in 1608 than it
had been in 1587 or 1597.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. The
methods in
which the
scarcity orders
of the Privy
Council were
executed in
1623 and 1630-1.</div>

<p>But in 1623 and in 1630-31 there are returns from many
different parts of the country, and these seem to
show that the orders which were occasionally put
in force under Elizabeth were frequently put in
force under James I., and were usually well executed
in the season of scarcity in the reign of
Charles I.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>a.</i> The suppression
of
alehouses, and
restrictions of
malting.</div>

<p>The Book of Orders issued in each period of scarcity contained
directions for limiting the quantity of malt
and for suppressing unnecessary alehouses. This
was the case because barley bread was the chief
food of the poor, and they would be more easily
able to obtain a supply if the barley which would have been used
for malt was brought to the markets. The corn reports of
1623 and 1630-1 for the most part state in general terms that
these directions had been carried out<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. Moreover sometimes
the justices enter into details and show that they had taken
great care in putting this part of the Council's orders into
execution. Thus in 1623 the number of alehouses in Banbury
was reduced by one-third, in Ripon by a half, while in Wycombe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>only nine were licensed out of twenty-one<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. In April 1631
also in Bradford, in Hertford, and in Stafford more than half
the alehouses were suppressed<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.</p>

<p>Similar details show us that the making of malt was carefully
regulated. In 1623 the justices of South Hampshire
fixed the total quantity of barley that might be used for this
purpose in the county and allotted a definite quantity to each
division: a hundred quarters were allotted to each of the
divisions of Andover and Fawley, eighty quarters to that of
Alton, and in proportion to the other divisions<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. At other times
malting was suppressed altogether, as in three hundreds of
Herefordshire in 1623<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> and at Taunton in 1631<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>.</p>

<p>Occasionally malting was continued by some of the maltsters,
but in order to counterbalance the injury to the poor they
contributed in some special way to their support. Thus at
Warwick in 1623 the maltsters brought corn to market and
sold at a shilling a bushel under the market price to the
poorer people, while at Stafford in 1631 the maltsters who had
continued their trade in the town agreed to contribute a
specified sum to the support of the poor in several of the
surrounding country districts<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. At Norwich some of the
maltsters were disobedient, and they were there ordered as a
punishment to bring corn to the public granary and sell it at
low rates to the poor<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>. It is thus clear that this regulation
of the consumption of ale was made in the interests of the
poor, and that it was carefully executed in 1623 and 1631.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>b.</i> Regulations
for
serving the
markets with
corn and for
supplying the
poor in their
homes.</div>

<p>As in 1586 and in 1597 elaborate surveys of the quantities
of corn possessed by each owner were made both
in 1623 and 1630-1, and in accordance with these
surveys the farmers were ordered to bring a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>portional
amount of their produce to market<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>.
Moreover in 1623 and in 1631 increased attention
was paid to the difficulties experienced by the labourers who
had not sufficient leisure to come to market for the small
quantities they were able to buy at a time. In Babergh and
Cosford and in Thingoe in 1623, arrangements were made for
their supply at home<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>. In 1631 more organised plans were
adopted. At Lewes a survey was made of the quantity of
corn available and a reasonable proportion was then allotted
to each householder: out of the residue the poor of every
parish were to have enough to serve them, while any that
was then left over was to be sent to market<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>: in the lath
of Shepway two-thirds of the corn was sold to poor artificers
at home, while only one-third was brought to market and there
sold to the poor or to anyone who wanted to buy for his own
consumption<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>c.</i> Selling
corn to
labourers
under price.</div>

<p>But in some respects the corn measures of 1623 and 1631
were not only better executed but provided more
direct relief than those of former times. We know
that the town rulers in 1586 and 1597 bought
particular quantities of corn for the inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>, and that
individual owners like the Duke of Rutland sold their corn
under price. The reports of 1623 and 1630-1 indicate a great
extension of this practice both in London, in other corporate
towns, and in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Corn sold
under price to
the poor in
London.</div>

<p>Even before 1520 the City rulers possessed a magazine of
corn. In 1622 a regular system of selling to the
poor under price was so much the usual plan that
the Lords of the Privy Council complained of the
method by which the Companies furnished their quota of
corn for this purpose. Each Company contracted with the
bakers to furnish the quantity required from its members.
The wardens however were told that this course "would rather

import for themselves from abroad so that the total supply in
the City might be increased<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>. In 1630-1 even more vigorous
methods were taken. The population of London was numbered,
so that it was found that there were 130,280 people in the
City, and the Lord Mayor calculated that five thousand quarters
a month would be necessary to provide for all the inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.
Each Company had to provide a certain quantity at under
rates for the poor and was required to state how much of this
supply they had in their granaries<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>. The efforts made to
lower the price were for a time successful, and in December
1630 the Lord Mayor ordered the price of meal to be reduced
in proportion to the fall in the price of grain<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Selling under
price in large
towns.</div>

<p>In other large towns similar plans were adopted both in
1621-1623 and in 1629-1631. In 1623 the
Bailiffs of Derby report "wee have alsoe at the
charge of the cheife and ablest inhabitants of this
Burrowe provided 140 q<sup>ters</sup> of corne w<sup>ch</sup> wee weekely afford to
the poore as their necessities require under the comon price of
the markett<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>." In the later period, 1630 and 1631, Norwich
spent £300 for this purpose and then borrowed more; Great
Yarmouth, Leicester and Buckingham made similar provision<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>There is no reason to think these towns were exceptional;
there are comparatively few reports from the corporate towns
in 1630 but we have already seen that in Bristol and Shrewsbury
stores had been bought in earlier years, and their
action was probably similar now to that of London and
Norwich.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stores of
corn sold
under price to
the country
labourers.</div>

<p>The same plan was also adopted in the country. It was
recommended by the Council, but it is not one
of the fixed regulations enforced by them. In
one case however we find that a small sum of
money had been collected for a magazine of corn
in Suffolk, and that now the Council ordered it to be used to
supply the poor of Halesworth<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>.</p>

<p>In many other cases corn was provided by the inhabitants
themselves often by voluntary agreement made under the
persuasion of the justices. In 1623 this method of helping
the poor was usual in Hertfordshire. In March the Sheriff
sends to the Council reports from the justices of the greater
part of the country. He states that the justices and gentlemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>have "by there good and charitable exsamples and perswasiones"
provided a quantity of corn at nearly half the market price in
"euery parish where neede requireth." There was enough
to last until next harvest and they hope "noe complainte of
the pore shall hereafter add any disturbance unto his Ma<sup>ti's</sup> most
graciouse pittifull, and charitable minde<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>."</p>

<p>In districts of Devonshire and Suffolk<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> also like plans were
tried in 1623, while in 1631 similar methods of relief seem to
have been universal in the counties of Essex and Norfolk, and
to have been adopted in some districts in almost every eastern
county.</p>

<p>Thus in December 1630 in four of the hundreds of Essex
arrangements were made for supplying the people with corn
at home. The chief inhabitants "of theire owne accords" laid
in a store for the poor allowing 7<i>d.</i>, 18<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> the bushel and
giving an equivalent amount in money to those that did not
bake their own bread<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>. Next month we hear that this plan
had been adopted in most of the shire; every parish had its
store and the poor were served at 18<i>d.</i> and 2<i>s.</i> a bushel under
the usual price. Sometimes when grain was scarce, bread and
money were given instead. Our informant states that this provision
of corn for the poor at cheap rates had had a considerable
effect in lowering the price of grain<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. From every hundred of
Norfolk a report of the state of the corn supply of the poor
was received, and some arrangement of this kind is usually
reported. In some hundreds two degrees of poverty were
recognised. The very poor only paid half-a-crown a bushel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>for their barley, but "the labourers y<sup>t</sup> had nott so much neede"
were served at three shillings<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.</p>

<p>This plan does not seem to have been general in Yorkshire,
but it was adopted by at least eight hundreds<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. There are
moreover many examples of stores of this kind in Hertfordshire
and some in every Eastern county except Northumberland
and Lincolnshire<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>. The fact that special mention is made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>poor labourers shows that relief was not confined to the disabled
or to paupers. It was given in the eastern counties
more than in the western probably because the scarcity was
more felt in the east and the poor were in greater distress<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>d.</i> Other
special
methods of
providing food
for the poor.</div>

<p>Sometimes other plans were adopted. The owners and
dealers of corn were expected to contribute to the
need of their less fortunate neighbours. At Reading
the corn masters set apart a sack in every load to
serve for the poor at twelvepence a bushel under
the market rate<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. It would seem that some allowance was
usually made by dealers in corn, for another dealer who was
a victim of a riot at Woodchurch states that out of ten quarters
he left five to be sold to the poor<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>.</p>

<p>Other expedients of this kind were adopted; in Devonshire
the children of the poor were billetted on those able to give
relief<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>, and at Maidstone the town baked the bread and gave
loaves to the day labourers and poorest inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>. Three
of the hundreds of Cambridgeshire tried a still more organised
plan: "the poorer sort had weekly corne delivered to them
at home at twelvepence in the bushell in the least under the
market prices<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Evidence
as to success
or failure of
the corn regulations.</div>

<p>We have very varied opinions as to the success or failure
of the organisation for supplying the poor with
corn. The justices in several instances state that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>the search raised prices, and ask that a second
search may not be made<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. In a few cases they
say the regulation of the markets was injurious. The most
decided of these is an account from Edwinstree and Odsey,
"And we humbly conceaue that o<sup>r</sup> strickt lookeing to the
marketts by o<sup>r</sup>selves and others, very sufficient and diligent
supervis<sup>ors</sup>, whom we haue imploied w<sup>th</sup> a great deale of care
in these businesses is an occacion that the marketts are the
smaller, the corne dearer and new shifts and devises are found
out<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>." In the autumn of 1631 inquiries as to the cause of the
scarcity were instituted, and the Bridport authorities candidly
replied that it was owing to the interference of the justices<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.
But perhaps the most interesting protest is that from Chipping
Wycombe. It was a town on the borders of Buckinghamshire,
which was largely inhabited by dealers in corn and was the
market for the neighbouring parts of Oxfordshire and Berkshire.
After the instructions of the Privy Council had been
followed, only a quarter of the usual quantity was brought to
the market. The dealers, the Mayor tells us, lost heavily
because the price of meal had been fixed by the Lord Mayor,
and both they and the farmers were disgusted at the lowering
of prices in other parts of the country. Formerly the badgers
had set aside sacks for the poor, and the farmers and others
had provided stores for them. This they now refused to do,
but the justices did their best and themselves sold to the poor
under the market rates<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>. The dislike of the orders is very
apparent in this report, but it bears witness to the fact that
they were sometimes successful, since prices had been lowered
in consequence in other parts of the country. But as Chipping
Wycombe was inhabited largely by corn-dealers, and as it drew
its supplies from other counties, the orders failed there, and
the fact that Chipping Wycombe was such a town may have
been not without its influence on the making of history, for
John Hampden, we are told, was one of the justices present
who witnessed the distress of this disastrous market-day. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>was not a position in which he would judge favourably of the
effects of governmental interference.</p>

<p>Still the balance of evidence is in favour of the orders.
When they were first put in force they seem to have had a
considerable effect in lowering the price. Many of the reports
sent in during the last half of December and beginning of
January tell us that this was the case<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>, though after the beginning
of the year prices again rose, because the corn was
wanted for seed as well as for food. However even as late as
April 30th a report from the district of Horncastle in Lincolnshire
informs us that the writers have ordered the markets
to be furnished every week with a particular quantity, and that
the price of oatmeal, which was the chief food of the poor in
that part of the country, had been lowered from eight groats to
one shilling and tenpence<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>.</p>

<p>There are other statements of the same kind<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>, but one of
the most strongly expressed of these is from the justices of
Suffolk, "We giue y<sup>r</sup> lo(rdshi)ps many humble thanks for your
great fauours shewed unto vs and to the whole state of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>county in these necessiteouse times by those most prudent,
compassionate and charitable considerations deliuered in your
bookes of directions and sent vnto vs w<sup>ch</sup> we haue w<sup>th</sup> our uttermost
endeauours laboured in euery parte to see accomplished
as well by o<sup>r</sup>selues as others. And we must acknowledge with
o<sup>r</sup> and the countryes great thankfulnesse unto y<sup>r</sup> lo(rdshi)ps
that y<sup>e</sup> benefit w<sup>ch</sup> hereof hath arisen hath bine beyonde all
expectation inestemable and of wonderful effect<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>."</p>

<p>But the strongest argument that on the whole these
measures were beneficial is to be found in the fact that they
were enforced throughout the country by the justices with
very few protests. The justices would as a rule be landlords
and generally corn owners; the regulations were against their
interests, and, unless they had thought that they contributed
to the public welfare, they would have complained more and
performed less. When they thought a course objectionable
they said so: many of them did not approve of a second search
of the stocks of corn<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>; in several instances they said that the
order to prevent millers from buying corn was not beneficial,
because the millers sold in small quantities to the poor who did
not come to market<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>. But the rest of the orders concerning corn
were enforced nearly always without comment or with approval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Reasons
for the adoption
of the
corn regulations.</div>

<p>It is not difficult to see reasons for the success of such an
organisation. Corn fluctuated violently in price
because of the narrowness of the area from which
the supplies came. Even with our own worldwide
supply a corner in wheat has been attempted
and for a time maintained. When little corn was imported
into England, and even counties were largely self-supporting,
farmers might easily raise the price by keeping back their
corn from market<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.</p>

<p>But the great price was not always the worst of the trouble.
The justices of Devonshire tell us that corn could not be had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>for money, and the statement is confirmed by Fitz-Geffrie in
his <cite>Curse of Corne-horders</cite>, "O miserable condition! the poore
man is put to a double labour, first to get a little money for
Corne and then to get a little corne for money &amp; this last is
the hardest labour; he might haue earned almost halfe a bushell
while hee runnes about begging to buy halfe a pecke<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>."</p>


<p>We must remember the narrowness of the market; the
excessive fluctuations in price, and the difficulty of finding a
seller willing to sell a small quantity of grain, before we can
criticise fairly the organisation which was established during
these years of high-priced corn.</p>

<p>In any case the corn orders of the Government seem to have
helped to maintain the public peace. In 1527, in 1551, in
1587, in 1597, and in 1623 the rise in the price of corn immediately
occasioned disorder<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>, and even in 1630 attacks were
made on the carts carrying corn, and there were other signs of
disturbance<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>. But in this last season of scarcity there was no
serious outburst. The orders of the Government probably
relieved the distress and certainly helped to convince the
people that their rulers were trying to help them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">4. Bearing
of the scarcity
measures on
the history of
poor relief.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>a.</i> The training
of the
justices.</div>

<p>The organisation for supplying the poor with corn in 1631
is both indirectly and directly connected with the
history of poor relief. We have already seen that
the orders for supplying corn seem to have suggested
the orders for the ordinary relief of the
poor, and that both sets of orders were worked by
similar methods. The season of 1630-1 is the first in which
the administrators seem to have properly fulfilled their duties.
Then the commands of the Government seem to have been
vigilantly enforced. This was not always easily accomplished,
rebellious inhabitants were coerced, negligent justices were
punished<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. But on the whole the justices seem to have worked
with zeal, and the success obtained by them during this
exceptional crisis must have made it easier for them to cope
with the relief of the poor in more ordinary times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>b.</i> The standard
of comfort
of the poorer
classes.</div>

<p>Moreover the direct relief afforded by the corn stores must
be taken into account when we attempt to estimate the amount
of comfort enjoyed by the manual workers in
the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>Prof. Rogers has compared the condition of
the labouring population at different times by estimating the
amount of food which could be bought by a labourer receiving
average wages in each period. This method of comparison leads
him to the conclusion that the majority of the population were
in a very miserable condition before the outbreak of the Civil
War<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.</p>

<p>But in 1630-1, and to some extent also in 1623, labourers
did not pay the market price for their food, and this fact must
modify any conclusion derived from such a source so far as the
reigns of James I. and Charles I. are concerned. Not only was
corn sold under price from public granaries and stores, but it is
probable that whenever arrangements were made to serve the
labourers at home the prices were somewhat reduced, as the
sellers would then be saved the trouble of taking the corn to
market, and the expense of paying the market tolls.</p>

<p>Moreover it has often been pointed out that the relative
comfort of any class can be better ascertained if we consider
the earnings of the family rather than those of the individual<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.
This was a period in which women could easily obtain work in
spinning and when children were apprenticed at an early age,
and so required little support from their parents. For these
reasons it seems likely that the labourer of the reign of
Charles I. would be better off than the amount of his wages
would lead us to suppose, and this estimate is confirmed by the
scale of diet fixed for the boys in the Children's Hospital of
Norwich in 1632.</p>

<p>The boys in the hospital were between the ages of ten and
fourteen. For dinner they were always to have six ounces of
bread and a pint of beer: three days in the week they had also
a pint of pottage and six ounces of beef, and on the remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>four an ounce of butter and two of cheese. For supper they
had always six ounces of bread, a pint of beer, an ounce of
butter and two of cheese, and for breakfast every day three
ounces of bread, half an ounce of butter and half a pint of beer<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>.
As this represents the food of the destitute orphans of Norwich
it is not likely to be much better than the usual standard of
the poorest class, and seems to compare very favourably with
the food of a boy in the same class in our own time. The
ordinary standard of living thus does not appear to be miserable,
but the poor must have suffered terribly, if there had been no
exceptional relief, whenever there was no work for them to do,
and when corn was double the usual price.</p>

<p>It is these fluctuations that were the chief source of misery,
and by lessening their effect the scarcity measures of the time
were of enormous importance to the whole of the labouring class.</p>

<p>But relief in times of emergency was afforded to the needy
in other times of exceptional distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Provision
of fuel for
the poor in
Winter.</div>

<p>In Winter fuel was provided. Thus at St Albans, wood
was bought for the poor in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>. In London there was a coal yard
before 1590, and early in the reign of James I.
the City authorities obtained permission to import four thousand
chaldron of "sea cole" free of duty for the purpose of supplying
those in need of help<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>. Payments for fuel formed part of the
regular organisation at Norwich<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>, and directions to secure a
supply to the poor of their district are contained also in the
orders to the overseers of 1623<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. This provision is another
illustration of the fact that a great deal of the relief given was
designed to protect the people from excessive fluctuations in
price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">6. Help in
times of sickness
and
plague.</div>

<p>Methods of relieving the poor in times of sickness were
also numerous. The Great Plague of London was
not an isolated attack; throughout the seventeenth
century few years pass without an outbreak
in one of the large towns. Special orders were drawn up to
prevent the spread of infection; watchmen were appointed to
guard stricken houses, and the inmates for the time had to be
supported by the community<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>. The cost of this severely taxed
local resources. At Cambridge we hear that in 1630, 2800
claimed relief and only seven score were able to contribute.
In this case a brief was issued authorising collections from
other parts<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>, and London and Norwich sent generous contributions<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>.
One town seems to have helped another frequently
when this scourge broke out: New Sarum sent aid to London,
Norwich to Yarmouth, and both New Sarum and Bury thanked
the Londoners for the help they had themselves received under
like circumstances<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>.</p>

<p>Pest houses were often established; at Reading eight were
built, and we hear of their erection in Norwich, London,
Cambridge and Windsor<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>. The way the funds were raised for
the plague-stricken poor of Windsor is one of the many illustrations
of the fact that private charity and public rates were
often used for the same purposes and administered by the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>officials. The site for the pest house was given by an alderman,
some of the money was raised for the relief of the
infected poor "by way of taxation," part was given by
gentlemen of the neighbourhood, and the rest was probably
paid out of the town chest<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>. At Hitchen and in other places
relief was given to the plague-stricken by means of the poor
law organisation<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.</p>

<p>The Privy Council frequently made orders connected with
the plague. Sometimes they ordered the erection of pest
houses, sometimes a special collection. In Grantham and
Worcester the rich fled from the infected town, so that government
was at a standstill; the absentees were required to pay
double rates and, if necessary, to return and help govern the
town<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>. At another time the paper-makers in Suffolk were
prevented from working because of the plague, and a special
collection was ordered for them<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>. All these orders illustrate
the paternal nature of the Privy Council government, and also
seem to show that in social matters it was exercised in favour
of the poor.</p>

<p>But not only in time of plague was provision made for the
sick. At Norwich it was part of the regular organisation
for the poor; in London St Thomas's and St Bartholomew's
hospitals were already in existence, and in most towns there
were numerous lazar houses. In some places the help provided
was even greater than that of to-day; a town physician was
appointed especially to look after the poor. Newcastle adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>this plan in the reign of Elizabeth, and the practice was continued
down to the time of the Civil War, and in 1629 a
"learned physician" was engaged by the Mayor and Corporation
of Barnstaple to give advice gratis to the poor<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>. This
happened just at the time when, as we have seen, there was
great activity in matters connected with the poor, and is an
illustration of the fact that the duties of the seventeenth
century municipality were very various, and that even in 1629
the town authorities were sometimes pioneers in matters concerning
the poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Contributions

<p>Fire was another way in which sudden loss was caused to
large numbers of people. Houses were still built
largely of wood and often very close together.
Whole towns were not infrequently destroyed.
Tiverton suffered twice in this way, and the suddenness of the
calamity to so flourishing a town seems to have especially
struck men's imagination. "He which at one a clocke was
worth fiue thousand pound and as the Prophet saith drunke his
Wine in bowles of fine Siluer plate, had not by two a clocke so
much as a woodden dish left to eate his meate in, nor a house
to couer his sorrowfull head"<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>. In the second destruction of
1612 three hundred of the poor people were boarded in the
shire, and collections to rebuild the town were made throughout
the country. Similar disasters happened to several other
towns, to Dorchester in 1613 and Hertford in 1637, and like
collections were made for them among charitable people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. Characteristics
of
seventeenth
century poor
relief.</div>

<p>Thus in the first half of the seventeenth century
relief in times of emergency forms a considerable
part of the assistance given to people in distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>a.</i> Little
distinction
between
paupers and
non-paupers.</div>

<p>That provided in years of high priced corn
was not distributed only to those who were usually paupers
but to the whole of the labouring class; that
afforded in times of fire or sickness affected all
classes of the community. There was thus much
less difference between paupers and the rest of the
community than there is to-day. All classes were relieved
because poor relief was originally part of a paternal system of
government under which the rulers regarded the maintenance
of the usual prosperity of every class as a part of their duties.
There is a curious case of landlord and farmer relief during the
season of plenty in 1619. It was then stated that of late
years there had been so much corn that the farmers were impoverished.
A letter was therefore sent to the justices of
every county ordering them to confer concerning some fit
place where a magazine might be provided for storing a
quantity of corn. The reason for this is stated to be that it is
the "care of the state to provyd as well to keepe the price of
corne in tymes of plenty at such reasonable rates as may
afford encouragemt and lively good to the farmer and husbandman
as to moderate the rates thereof in time of scarcitie for
the releefe of the poorer folke"<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>. Few regulations could make
it clearer than this, that the paternal measures of the Government
were not confined to one particular class, but affected the
whole of the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><i>b.</i> Little
distinction
between relief
afforded by
voluntary
donations
and that
provided by
poor rates.</div>

<p>The distinction between paupers and non-paupers therefore
was much less clear than it is to-day, and it is
also true that the distinction between voluntary
contributions and compulsory poor rates was much
less rigidly defined. The supply of the poor with
corn is nearly always stated to have been a
voluntary measure, but it was carried out under
very considerable pressure from the justices. Sometimes the
pressure amounted to compulsion. Thus in the Sarum division
of Wiltshire some gave "franklie and freely good quantities of
their store" to the poor but others were "wilfull." The
justices "terrified them a little w<sup>th</sup> conventing them before the
Lords of the Counsell and then they seemed very willing and
tractable"<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>. It is difficult to say therefore how far the corn
charities of the time were voluntary and how much they were
compulsory. There was also a close connection between
private and public charity in other forms of relief.</p>

<p>Probably in every town there were numbers of endowed
charities controlled by the municipal officers or by overseers or
by some public or semi-public authorities, which were practically
a part of the same system as that enforced by law. Such
were the four royal hospitals of London and the hospitals of
Gloucester and Norwich. Such also were the many almshouses
under the management of corporations, as were the almshouses
founded respectively by Leche and by Kendrick at Reading,
and the many charities for apprenticing poor children and
lending money to poor tradesmen, which we shall afterwards
consider in detail. Sometimes the connection was closer still,
and the workhouse like the Free Library of to-day might be
partly provided by private generosity and partly by public
rates. Such was the case with the Barnstaple workhouse and
the Jersey school of Newark<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>.</p>

<p>The relief of the poor in times of emergency thus brings
into prominence two of the main features of the poor relief of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>the time. First, that the public compulsory system was
developed from a voluntary system and that in the seventeenth
century voluntary and public poor relief were closely connected.
Secondly, that the poor relief of the time was
intimately connected with the general system of government
under which all classes were compelled by Government to do
their duties and any class might be relieved that for the time
failed to obtain its usual degree of prosperity.</p>

<p>We have seen how the poor were relieved in times of
special emergency; we will now examine the kind of help that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was bestowed upon those classes of poor who in almost every
community were more or less constantly in need of assistance.
We will notice first the relief given to the impotent and aged
poor; secondly, the measures adopted to provide for destitute
children; and lastly, the methods used to find work for the
unemployed or to suppress vagrants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">α. The impotent
poor.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright">1. Almshouses
and
endowed
charities.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright"><i>a.</i> Old endowments
which remained
unchanged
through the
Reformation.</div>

<p>The method of relieving the impotent poor differed very
considerably from that with which we are familiar.
The workhouses of the seventeenth century were
mainly places for people who could work, the aged and impotent
poor were often relieved by almshouses controlled
by public and by private authorities, but founded
and maintained by private liberality. It was indeed
an age in which almshouses or hospitals as they were
often called abounded. Probably there were nearly as many in
existence then as there are to-day, in spite of the
fact that our population has increased sixfold.
Some of these hospitals were old endowments
that had survived the Reformation; others had
been dissolved with the other religious houses
and regranted to the municipal authorities of the place to which
they belonged; many more were founded during the reigns of
Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I.</p>

<p>The well-known Hospital of St Cross at Winchester is a
good example of an old foundation that has had a continuous
existence from its first endowment in the middle ages until the
present day. The modern tourist, like the wayfarer of mediæval
times, may partake of the refreshment provided by its ancient
regulations, and may still receive his bread and beer like a
seventeenth century beggar. But it has also been an almshouse
since the time of Henry II. By the Charter of Foundation
"thirteen poor men, feeble and so reduced in strength, that they
can scarcely, or not at all, support themselves without other
aid, shall remain in the same hospital constantly; to whom
necessary clothing, provided by the Prior of the Establishment,
shall be given, and beds fit for their infirmities; and daily a
good loaf of wheaten bread of the weight of five measures, three
dishes at dinner and one for supper, and drink in sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
quantity<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>." This hospital was not dissolved by Henry VIII.
but continued under its old regulations throughout the Reformation.
Laud ordered inquiries to be made concerning it
shortly after 1627, and the thirteen pensioners were then
maintained with full allowances<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>. Many hospitals survived the
dissolution besides St Cross and remained in private hands;
a few like St Giles's, Hereford, or St Bartholomew's at Sandwich
had been governed by the town-rulers from the time of their
foundation<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>, and these for the most part retained their old
endowments and remained under municipal management.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <i>b</i>. Old
endowments
regranted to
the Corporation
or other
public body.</div>

<p>Other hospitals were regranted to the Corporations of their
respective cities and towns soon after the dissolution
in the same way as St Bartholomew's had
been given to the City of London. Such was the
case with St Bartholomew's of Gloucester. Queen
Elizabeth stipulated that some of the payments formerly made
by the Crown should be remitted, but placed the rest of the
revenues in the hands of the Corporation on condition that
a physician and surgeon and forty poor people should be there
maintained<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>. Two other of the ancient hospitals of Gloucester
came into the hands of the Corporation. One of these,
St Margaret's Hospital, provided for ten poor men in 1562,
and was then governed by the town authorities; the other,
St Mary Magdalen, was granted to the city both by Queen
Elizabeth and King James, and was called King James's
Hospital<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>. Even if a hospital came into private hands it often
returned to its original purpose. Sentiment as to its rightful
use was probably very strong in the case of any institution
which had been founded to do a work which obviously needed
doing. Thus Kineburgh's, another of the old hospitals of
Gloucester, had been sold at the dissolution to a Mr Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Bell, and was afterwards refounded by him and placed under
the care of the Corporation. His donation was confirmed by
Queen Elizabeth, and during the reign of James several other
small endowments were added by various donors for the maintenance
of the poor there<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>.</p>

<p>Gloucester was perhaps especially fortunate in retaining so
many of its old endowments, but elsewhere similar arrangements
were made. St Giles's of Norwich, St Leonard's of Launceston,
St Edmund's of Gateshead, St Thomas's and St Catherine's of
York, St Mary Magdalen's of King's Lynn, and Trinity Hospital
of Bristol were all old foundations which, during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, came into the hands of the corporation
of the town to which they severally belong<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. St Giles's
Hospital of Norwich may be taken as an example of these
re-established hospitals. According to the Letters Patent of
Edward VI. it was granted to the Mayor and Corporation
of Norwich, and was to be called the House of God or the
House of the Poor: forty men and four matrons were to be
provided for; they were to receive bed and bed-clothes, bread,
meat, drink and firing. The pensioners were not appointed
for life, but were removable from week to week or from day to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>day<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. This hospital therefore was very much like a modern
workhouse, except that it was supported by endowments or
by voluntary subscriptions.</p>

<p>Occasionally these ancient charities came to be managed by
the vestry. Thus in Bristol there were three old endowments
of this sort. Redcliffe almshouse was supposed to have been
established about 1440 by the famous Bristol merchant William
Canninge; the Temple Gate almshouse and Burton's were
probably foundations of an even earlier date. The two former
were governed by the vestry of St Mary, Redcliffe, and long
before 1821 had become simply houses in which aged paupers
were placed by the overseers<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. Burton's almshouse was
governed by the vestry of St Thomas's parish, and was used
as an almshouse from which paupers were not excluded. These
institutions had thus then become part of the compulsory and
legal system of poor relief rather than of the voluntary charity
which existed by its side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <i>c</i>. Fresh
endowments.</div>

<p>But not only were there many old foundations for helping
the aged poor, but the century from 1550 to 1650
was itself the great time of the foundation of new
almshouses. It is rare to find a town of any size in which some
institutions of this kind were not established during these years,
though in country parishes they were not so frequent. They
were governed in many different ways, but generally by some
public body or by some set of men closely connected with the
authorities who were responsible for the administration of poor-relief.
Some were governed by the Corporation like the small
almshouse founded by Fox at Beverley. Many resembled the
Temple Hospital at Bristol; this was endowed by Sir Thomas
White and was vested in trustees who were members of the
Corporation. A few were managed by merchant or craft
companies associated with the government of the town; such
was the case with the Merchants' Hospital of Bristol and
Dame Owen's almshouses in Islington. Others were in the
hands of private trustees sometimes connected with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>founder's family, at other times with his position. The Archbishops
of Canterbury were generally associated with some
of the favourite charities of the time. Grindal provided a
stock for setting the poor to work, Abbot a workhouse, Laud
apprenticeship endowments, and Whitgift an almshouse at
Croydon for twenty-eight poor people, the government of which
he vested in his successors in the see of Canterbury. These
hospitals were usually filled by the aged and impotent of the
poorer classes. But occasionally they also supplied the wants
of the poor in a better social position. The Charterhouse of
Colonel Newcome fame was a foundation of the reign of King
James, and supplied a refuge for eighty poor gentlemen, merchants,
soldiers, or mariners.</p>

<p>Altogether the almshouses of the time formed a very important
part of the provision for the poor. In some towns like
that of Hereford<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> they were extremely numerous. Other places
like Morton Hampstead seem to have established a public
almshouse for the poor, but as a rule these institutions were
privately endowed, and the help given by them was thus free
from the sting that is attached to legal and compulsory charity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <i>d</i>. Pensions
and gifts from
endowed
charities.</div>

<p>But besides the almshouses many other charities were
founded to help the aged poor, some of which
have proved of doubtful benefit to their successors.
Many pensions and gifts of small amount were
distributed by public or semi-public bodies. The City Companies
of London frequently received bequests of this kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Thus the Clothworkers administer the gift of Sir Thomas
Trevor. In 1622 he bequeathed £100 in order that six poor
women might have 20s. a piece in quarterly instalments. At
Bristol every week some one poor widow receives 10<i>s.</i> from
Mr Whitson's charity, and two poor householders have 20<i>s.</i>
each, though neither widow nor householder can have the gift
more than once in the same year<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.</p>

<p>Innumerable smaller charities also exist in particular towns
and parishes ordering the distribution of sixpences and shillings
on particular Sundays or Feasts, or after the hearing of some
sermon. Even more frequently bread charities were established.
Thus in Hereford Cathedral twelve poor people receive a loaf
every Saturday, and sixpence on twelve of the principal feasts
and vigils of the year<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. Sometimes so many poor men or
women are "apparelled," or gowns, shirts and smocks are
bought and distributed: more often fuel and wood are provided<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.
Bequests of this kind are very numerous, but the
amount of relief afforded to each individual is often ridiculously
small. Still the value of money was three or four times greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>then than it is to-day, and a pension of 10<i>s.</i> or 20<i>s.</i> was a much
greater contribution towards the maintenance of the poor person.
Moreover, parochial authorities and officials of City Companies
had comparatively few people to deal with, and it was possible
for them to know something about the recipients of these
charitable doles.</p>

<p>Altogether the number of endowed charities which afforded
assistance to old people was large in the seventeenth century
in comparison with the number of persons who were in need of
relief. Moreover, new almshouses were continually founded
throughout this period and until the close of the century.
Probably many of these are in existence to-day, but there has
been no increase at all proportionate to the growth of the
population, while a few of the old institutions like the Redcliffe
almshouse at Bristol have become part of the legal system of
relief while others have disappeared altogether<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Provision

<div class="sidenoteright">2 <i>a</i>. Relief
provided by
county funds.</div>

<p>But although the aged poor were largely relieved by almshouses
there were still many who were provided
for by the legal and compulsory system. Some
hospitals were supported by the county funds.
There were several in the North Riding of Yorkshire
which were used as almshouses for the
impotent and aged poor and received grants from the County
Treasurer<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.</p>

<p>Aged soldiers and sailors were also provided for not by the
parish but by the county. As we should expect this was found
to be a heavy charge in Devonshire, and the magistrates
grumbled at the amount they had to give for this purpose<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">2 <i>b</i>. Relief of
the aged by
means of
pensions from
the parish or
by the provisions
of
houses or free
board and
lodging.</div>

<p>More often the aged poor were relieved by the funds raised by
the parish. Two methods seem to have been
adopted. The most usual was what we should
now call a system of out-relief. Pensions were
granted varying in amount from threepence to
two shillings a week, but generally about one
shilling<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>. Sometimes in addition rent was paid
and often habitations were provided which were built by the
overseers on the waste<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>. But the poor in these were not under
any special control but were allowed to look after themselves in
other respects. In some parishes, however, instead of receiving
weekly pensions the poor were billeted on the rich. In a
report from the district of Furness and Cartmell, one hundred
and seventy-six people were relieved in this manner, and two
hundred and eighty-eight by means of pensions. In this case
each parish adopted one method or the other exclusively; thus
in Alythwaite thirty-nine poor were billeted, in Coniston
twelve were provided for by money payments<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>. In other cases
the method of billeting existed as an exceptional practice side
by side with the pension system. Thus in Staplegrove, Somerset,
in 1599, after the list of payments given for the poor, there are
the names of two men, each of whom kept a poor impotent
person in his house<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>.</p>

<p>The parochial system of the time was therefore mainly a
system of out-relief and sometimes free lodging, but it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>modified by a practice of "boarding out" the aged. It was of
considerably less importance than it is to-day because the
amount of endowed charities bore a much greater proportion to
the number of old who were to be relieved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">β. Children.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright">3 <i>a</i>. Apprenticeship
to
masters.</div>

<p>We will now consider the main methods of providing for
the young. Compulsory education does not seem
to be peculiar to the nineteenth century. In the
reign of Charles I. all children had to be taught
to work and trained to a trade. The method chiefly employed
was that of apprenticeship. But schools, training homes and
orphanages also existed in which children received the technical
education of the time. Parents were obliged to apprentice
their children or put them into service as soon as they were old
enough. If the parents were able they paid the preliminary
fee themselves; if not, the parish found masters for the children,
but in this case they often had to work at the more unskilled
trades. Sometimes money was paid for the pauper apprentice
as for any other child, but at other times men were forced to
keep the children without payment. There was often, as we
should expect, a great deal of friction in the matter. In a
report from Yorkshire, signed by Lord Fairfax, we are told that
the justices do their best to find masters and keep the children
with them, but that there was considerable difficulty in so
doing<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. Elsewhere there are also hints that the masters
wished to free themselves from any burden of the kind<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>, but
there is much to make us think that on the whole the method
at this time worked well. It was apparently the favourite
remedy for the time for the evils of poverty. The writers of
the legal handbooks insist that it was an especially important
part of the duty of overseers<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>, while throughout the seventeenth
century numerous bequests for the purpose were left by private
persons<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>. This is very strong evidence that the philanthropists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>of the time thought that the binding of poor children apprentice
was an excellent way of providing for their maintenance
and training. Laud himself was especially interested in the
matter. In his own lifetime he made a gift for the purpose of
apprenticing ten poor boys of Reading<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, and either during his
lifetime or by his will he also provided funds for the same
object in Croydon, Wokingham, Henley, Wallingford, and New
Windsor<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. Moreover the Privy Council appear to have specially
enforced this part of the relief of the poor and to have demanded
and received more detailed reports on this subject than on any
other. This action of the Privy Council and the number of
these bequests therefore make us believe that the evils of pauper
apprenticeship were not very prominent in the seventeenth
century. No doubt the fact that it was then the usual custom
for an apprentice to board with his master and not a practice
chiefly confined to children brought up by charity, made a great
difference. Both kinds of apprentices were bound in the same
way and would tend to be dealt with in the same manner. The
selection of the master would make the principal difference;
and the welfare of the apprentice would depend upon the care
taken by the administrators of the charities and the parochial
funds in providing masters for the children.</p>

<p>The picture in the <cite>Fortunes of Nigel</cite> of Jenkin Vincent,
the London apprentice of this time brought up at Christ's
Hospital, could not have been very unlike the reality. Great
hardship must have been inflicted in some cases<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>, but when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>practice was new and the custom general, the apprentice bound
by charitable funds would not usually be treated much worse
than other apprentices. Otherwise it is not probable the Privy
Councillors in their public capacity, and an Archbishop and
many other charitable people in their private capacities, would
have taken so much trouble to extend this practice by finding
the funds for the purpose of thus providing for the maintenance
and education of poor children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3 <i>b</i>. In the
bridewells, or
Industrial
schools of the
time.</div>

<p>But not all destitute children were bound apprentice to
masters in the town. The bridewells or workhouses
of the time had often a special children's
department which seems to correspond with our
own Industrial schools.</p>

<p>The London Bridewell had thus two distinct functions to
perform. On the one side it was a House of Correction, on the
other it was a technical school for young people. Sometimes
the orphaned sons of freemen were received there, at other
times children were sent by the overseers of the parishes, and
often young vagrants were brought in from the London streets.
They were trained in very various occupations: a full report of
the hospital was drawn up in 1631, and we are then told that
"four silk weavers keep poore children taken from the streets or
otherwise distressed, to the number of forty-five."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>There were also more than a hundred others at that time in
the Hospital who were apprenticed to pinmakers, ribbon weavers,
hempdressers, linen weavers, and carpenters<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>. Christ's Hospital
at Ipswich, the Hospital at Reading, and the Nottingham House
of Correction, had all training departments of this kind in
which many of the poor children of these towns were taught
trades.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Schools
for little
children and
orphanages.</div>

<p>Besides all this, children who were too young to be apprenticed
were in many places taught to spin and
sometimes to read and write. We have seen that
in Norwich in every parish "a select woman" was
appointed for this purpose in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
and in 1630 a similar order was made to the effect "that a
knittinge schooledame shalbe provided in every parishe where
there is not one already, to sett children and other poore on
worke<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>." Even in the hamlets like those of Whitwell and
Sellside, in the county of Westmoreland, three poor boys were
maintained at the school by the parish who were to be taught
trades as soon as they were old enough<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. In Hertfordshire we
are told that many had been placed as apprentices "and such
as are not of fitt yeares to bee put forth wee haue caused to
bee sett to spinning and such smale worke as is most meete
for them according to the tendernesse of their age that idlenesse
may not fasten in them<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>."</p>

<p>These schools were not improbably very numerous. In
documents containing the instructions of justices to overseers
knitting schools were advocated. Thus in directions issued in
1622 by some of the justices of Norfolk for the hundreds of
Eynesford and South Erpingham, the justices resolve "that
poore children be put to schoole to knittinge and spinninge
dames and the churchwardens and ouerseers for the poore to paie
the schoole dames their wages where the parents are not able<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>All this points to a system of popular education of the kind
then approved.</p>

<p>In the largest towns orphanages also were established about
this time. Christ's Hospital in London, as we have seen, was
originally established for the little children of the London
streets. During this period there were from seven to nine
hundred children maintained at the cost of this institution,
some in London and some at nurse in the country<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>. At Bristol
there were two establishments of the same kind. Queen
Elizabeth's Hospital was founded by a citizen named John Carr
after the model of Christ's Hospital in London. The boys
were subject to the same regulations and still wear the same
blue and yellow dress<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. The Red Maid's School was endowed
by the will of John Whitson in 1621. It was to consist of a
matron and forty girls. The children were to learn to read and
sew and do such other work as the matron and the Mayor's
wife should approve. They were to be apprenticed for eight
years, to wear clothes of red cloth, and attend on the wives of
the Mayor and aldermen on state occasions<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>. In Plymouth,
Exeter, and Norwich also there were similar institutions, but
they seem to have only existed in the large towns. Both in
the country and towns orphaned and deserted children were
generally "boarded out" until they were old enough to be
apprenticed, and payments were made for them from the rates
amounting to about a shilling a week.</p>

<p>Children were thus very well provided for, and their training
was considered a matter of national concern. Parents, whether
they were very poor or not, were compelled to send their
children to work or school and either to apprentice them or to
find situations for them. We are apt to consider popular education
an exclusively modern movement, but in this, as in many
other matters, the aims of the seventeenth century anticipate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>those of the nineteenth. They had ideas which were very
different from those of to-day as to the kind of training which
was necessary, but they attached an equal importance to the
necessity of training. The Town Council of Norwich and the
justices of Hertfordshire and Norfolk took energetic action in
the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">γ. The able-bodied
poor.</div>

<div class="sidenote">5. Relief
given to
prisoners.</div>

<p>We will now see how the administration of
the time affected the able-bodied poor. The help
given to the unemployed is by far the most important
part of this relief, but some aid was also
given to prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners of the sixteenth century must have suffered
great hardships. No adequate means seem to have existed for
their maintenance. Their friends supported them, and under
certain regulations they were allowed to beg. Several statutes
made in the reign of Elizabeth provided partially for their
support as part of the relief of the poor<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>. By the statute of
1601 prisoners were to be relieved by a county rate. The
County Treasurer, who was responsible for the relief of soldiers
and hospitals, also disbursed a part of the funds to them, and
every county was bound to pay at least twenty shillings a year
to the prisoners of the King's Bench and Marshalsea<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>. Still
the help given was very small; up to 1650 the allowance
granted to the poor in the Norfolk prison was only a penny a
day<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>, and this sum could barely have sufficed to keep them
alive. In Devonshire their allowance was increased in 1608
because "divers of them of late have perished through want"<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>.
We must remember that incarceration in these prisons was the
fate of debtors. Charitable people tried to help these people,
and bequests were often made for the purpose of granting them
some assistance. Thus in the reign of Charles I. George
White of Bristol left a gift of five pounds a year to be used for
the purpose of freeing or relieving some of the prisoners in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Bristol Newgate, and there are many other bequests of the
same kind<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. Still the amount of these legacies was wholly
insufficient for the need. Certainly neither the legislators nor
the administrators of the reigns of the earlier Stuarts made the
criminal poor more comfortable than the unfortunate poor. If
we realise the condition of the prisoners of this time we can
understand why Houses of Correction were regarded as charitable
foundations. We can also see how it was that whipping
and stocking were so frequently inflicted and that they were
comparatively merciful punishments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Provision
of funds to
provide work
for the unemployed.</div>

<p>But the provision for the unemployed workmen is by far
the most characteristic part of the early seventeenth
century administration. A man who was
unemployed and had no resources had either to
beg or to steal. If he begged, he was whipped;
if he stole, he went to one of the terrible prisons of the time.
The bands of armed vagrants, who made themselves terrible by
their numbers and defied the law, were therefore only a natural
consequence of the social conditions of the period. Repressive
measures were tried but did not succeed because force could
not restrain a man from begging if that was his only means of
escaping starvation. The provision of work which had been
made for the unemployed before 1597 was quite inadequate,
and it remained for the earlier Stuarts to develope and extend
the system.</p>

<p>We will examine first some of the methods of raising funds
which now came to be utilised, and secondly a few of the
various plans adopted in different places at different times with
the object of employing the poor.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the time that the money was fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>quently
provided by private people. At Guildford Archbishop
Abbot founded a workhouse, and we are told that the poor men
of the town were employed to spin flax and hemp into cloth,
and that this was found to be a "great comfort to many poore
workefolke men, women and children<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>".</p>

<p>At New Windsor several sums of money were left for this
purpose. One of these was bequeathed by Andrew Windsor in
a will dated 1621. He bequeathed £200, the annual interest
from which amounted to fourteen pounds. With this the poor
were to be set to work in the making of cloth. To some extent
the donor's intentions were fulfilled up to the present century.
During the eighteenth century and up to 1829 the money was
expended in setting the poor to work to spin sheeting<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.</p>

<p>There were many other gifts of the same kind, but of some
no farther trace has been found, while others are employed for
a somewhat different purpose<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these voluntary contributions the finding of work
for the unemployed was still in some cases regarded mainly as
a municipal duty. Thus at Richmond in Yorkshire before
1631 the money for this purpose had been provided from the
town chest, and about the same time a contribution was
requested but not obtained from the Corporation of Wells<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.</p>

<p>Usually however the funds were provided by means of
parochial rates. A lump sum was raised called the "stock."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>This was expended in purchasing materials and implements,
and ought to have been continuously replaced when the finished
products were sold. A "stock" was thus obtained in the three
parishes of Beverley; each parish contributed six or seven
pounds, besides the amount they formerly had, and the poor
were employed in spinning hemp<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>.</p>

<p>It was usually in these three ways that the money was
raised for the purpose of finding work for the unemployed, but
many different methods were used in the administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>a</i>. Stocks
used to employ
the poor in
their houses or
elsewhere.</div>

<p>We will now examine some of the more typical cases of
setting the poor to work. Generally we hear that
stocks were raised and the poor found with work,
but we do not hear that the work was done in any
public building. It does not follow that a building
was not used, but we do not hear that one was provided.
We will first notice a few instances in which the poor were set to
work in this way, and we will then examine some of the Jersey
schools and the workhouses and Houses of Correction of the
period. Lastly, we will endeavour to see what expedients were
adopted by public or semi-public authorities to provide the
poor with work without directly employing them. Under this
head we will notice such expedients as emigration, putting
pressure on employers, and the various ways in which a young
artisan or tradesman was helped to set up in business for
himself.</p>

<p>We shall see later that all these expedients were adopted
much more often after 1631 than before it, and it is at that
date that our information is most complete. About that time
we hear of several ways in which the poor were employed
directly or indirectly by the public authorities, but in which we
are not told of the erection of a workhouse or other building of
the kind. In Winchester, for instance, the stock was placed in
a clothier's hands; at Maidstone "the towne doth ymploy
poore women and their children in spinning, making of buttons
and twisting of threed for the same." In two of the hundreds<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>of Shropshire "the poore of euery paryshe w<sup>th</sup>in the said
hundreds are sufficiently provided for and are not permitted to
wander or beg but are set to worke on husbandry as the state
of the countrey doth require."</p>

<p>All these and many other instances are reported in 1631,
but there are examples at other times. At Norwich many
plans were tried<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>, but in 1625 it was resolved that the stone-mines
should be used for that purpose. The workmen were to
be "sett on worke" the next Monday at eight o'clock and surveyors
were ordered to be present. "And the Belman ys
required to warne all such as want worke and dwell not in
infected howses to repaire thither at that hower w<sup>th</sup> barrowes
and fittinge tooles to digg stone &amp; they shall be compounded
w<sup>th</sup>all for reasonable wages<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>."</p>

<p>At King's Lynn also different expedients were adopted. As
early as 1581 money had been spent in changing St James's
Church into a workhouse, and shortly afterwards we have
evidence of employment being then given to the poor. In
1623 the building was pulled down, and possibly in consequence
of this we find an agreement made in that year between the
citizens on the one side and a merchant taylor, a glover and a
woolchapman on the other. These last undertook not only to
teach children to spin worsted yarn, but also to give employment
to the poor, and to pay proper wages to those who were
not learners. In June, 1631, the Mayor and the Recorder sent
in a report to the Sheriff, in which they said that then they had
"bought materialls to sett the able-bodyed poore on worke not
suffering to o<sup>r</sup> knowledge anie poore to stragle and begg upp
and downe the streets of this Burgh<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>." In Lynn, therefore, the
authorities on several occasions made energetic efforts to find
employment for those out of work, and very possibly some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>arrangement of this sort was in continuous operation from the
year 1581.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>b</i>. Introduction
of new
trades.</div>

<p>Sometimes the authorities utilised the labour of their poor
in order to establish a new trade. Thus in eight
of the towns of Hertfordshire public funds were
obtained for an unsuccessful attempt to employ
those out of work in making serges and baize, then called the
"new drapery<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>." A project of the same kind was suggested to
the justices of Pembrokeshire, but they were very cautious
about committing themselves to its adoption<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.</p>

<p>Our informants generally tell us only that stocks were raised
and the poor set to work. But from the instances we have just
examined we can see that many kinds of employment were
used. On the whole clothmaking and the provision of flax,
hemp and tow were the most usual expedients.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>c</i>. Workhouses
and
Jersey schools.</div>

<p>But both private employers and public officials found that if
the very poor took work into their homes they
might embezzle the materials. Moreover, the
seventeenth century administrators often carefully
provided for the training of workers, and this could be more
conveniently done in some building. We, therefore, hear of
the erection of workhouses and Jersey schools and the continued
use of Houses of Correction. At Newbury and Reading
institutions of this kind were founded by Mr Kendrick. At
Newbury we are told threescore persons were employed in the
trade of clothing and other manufactures, most of these "being
houskeepers and havinge wyfes and children depending upon
their labours." Besides this fifty households were set to work by
spinning for the workhouse, and a "stock" was raised by taxation
to be partly expended "to imploie the poore in worke<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>."</p>

<p>We have detailed accounts of the Sheffield corporation.
From these we find that they spent about two hundred
pounds in building a workhouse and providing the necessary
materials. The details of the construction were very carefully
planned; the carpenters were sent to Newark to see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>workhouse there and every item of expenditure is set down in
the accounts<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>.</p>

<p>At Taunton and Abingdon similar institutions seem to have
been established in consequence of the special activity of the
years after 1630. The Taunton workhouse was newly built in
May 1631, and some children and others who were able to work
were already sent there to be trained in labour<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>. In June also
in 1631 the Mayor of Abingdon reports that "wee haue erected
w<sup>th</sup>in our borough a workehouse to sett poore people to worke<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>."</p>

<p>At Cambridge the workhouse was also a House of Correction.
In 1628 many houses had already been built for the
benefit and employment of the poorer sort of people, and in
that year Hobson gave the town the site without Barnwell Gate
on condition that a more convenient place should be erected.
This was soon afterwards begun, and was partially paid for
by certain sums, which had been sent to the town for the
plague-stricken poor in 1631, and which after that time
remained in the hands of the Corporation. In 1675 Hobson's
workhouse was still not only a House of Correction but a place
where five combers could be employed if they wanted work,
and where all the poor people of the town that desired to
have work in spinning and weaving were to be provided with
employment and to be paid the usual wages<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.</p>

<p>In these cases the workhouses are all in large towns, but in
one country district there were small institutions of the kind in
the parishes. The justices responsible for Little Holland in
Lincolnshire report in 1635 that in "all our seuerall parishes
wee haue a Towne stocke with a workhouse, a master and
utensills and that there hath beene aboue two hundred poore
people sett on worke and imployed weekly by the officers<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>."</p>

<p>Workhouses were thus fairly numerous and varied greatly
in size. They were not then like a modern workhouse, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>were places where people who could work were sent that they
might be trained and employed. They were, too, municipal or
parochial institutions, whereas Houses of Correction were not
parochial, but were either municipal or county undertakings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>d</i>. Bridewells.</div>

<p>In the sixteenth century we have seen that the distinction
between the two was not very great, but in this
period the new Houses of Correction are much
more like gaols. This is especially the case with those erected
by public funds, those which were privately endowed still
retained much of their old character. London, Bristol, Norwich,
Gloucester and many other places had organised their Bridewells
either before or during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and
we have already noticed that there were four Houses of Correction
in Devonshire in 1598<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. If was during the early part
of the seventeenth century however that Houses of Correction
appear to have been established in every county. They formed
a necessary part of the system of the time. You could
not provide work and maintenance for everybody unless you
had some arrangement for coercing idlers. A great many of
these institutions appear to have been established or revived
after 1597. In 1598 one was founded at Liverpool, and in 1601
some measures of the same kind were taken in Nottingham and
in Kendal, Westmoreland<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.</p>

<p>Others were erected shortly after the statute of 1610 was
passed: thus in 1614 the City of London consented to help the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>counties of Middlesex and Surrey to build Houses of Correction:
about the same time the Nottingham burgesses furnished and
reorganised St John's Hospital for this purpose, and both
Preston and Manchester had followed the same example before
1620<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>. In the reports of 1630 to 1639 the existence of Houses
of Correction is assumed, since the justices state how many idlers
have been sent to them<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>. Sometimes the reports give a few
details concerning them; at Hastings the justices tell us they
have kept their House of Correction in good repair<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>, and from
the justices of Edwinstree and Odsey in 1631 we learn that a
House of Correction had been long maintained at Buntingford,
and that the justices send their prisoners there although there
is a more important institution of the kind in the county,
fourteen miles distant<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>. The justices' reports thus indicate
that Houses of Correction were established in most places
before 1635. This impression is confirmed by a letter from
the Earl of Pembroke to the justices of South Wiltshire. He
complains that there is no place of the kind nearer than Devizes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>and he asks the Council to enforce his request that another
should be built in Wiltshire<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>. This letter would hardly have
been written unless in 1623 it was usual for Houses of Correction
to be nearer than Devizes is to South Wiltshire, and seems
therefore to show that they were now a general institution.</p>

<p>Their character seems to have been much the same as in
the preceding century. They provided a temporary lodging for
stranger vagrants and a house of detention in which the idlers
and offenders convicted for small causes could be made to work
hard and were possibly reformed. Coarse kinds of labour were
used at the London Bridewell, mainly the beating of hemp, but
sometimes other plans were tried and the prisoners were put
under the care of undertakers who agreed to keep them all at
work and made such profit as they were able<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>.</p>

<p>But there were many other ways in which the unemployed
were provided for. The modern remedy of emigration was
adopted, pressure was put upon employers and there were
various ways in which money could be lent to set a young
householder up in business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>e</i>. Emigration.</div>

<p>It was about this time, and partly in connection with Bridewell,
that the remedy offered by emigration was
adopted. It was the age in which several of our
colonies were founded and first developed. The earliest vagrant
emigrants were sent to Virginia. We hear of a payment of
12<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> from a London parish "towards the transportacon of a
hundred children to Virginia by the Lord Maior's appointment,"
in 1617 and in 1619<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>. Again, in 1622 and 1635, vagrants were
detained in Bridewell for Virginia, who were usually paid for
by municipal funds and collections, though in a few cases we
are told that the parochial officials sent particular people and
paid their expenses. A few years later some vagabonds were
sent to sea, and others were put to work in the Barbadoes<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.
The emigrants did not come only from London; three boys of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Barnstaple departed in 1633-4, and probably there were many
more both from Barnstaple and other places. The emigrants
thus sent out were bound apprentice for some years to some
employer, and at the end of their term of years they were to
have the opportunity of making plantations for themselves.
There is a declaration made in 1647, by the Earl of Carlisle,
who was Lord of the Caribee Islands, in which it is stated that
there was not land enough in Barbados for all who had served
their time<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>, and that every freeman unprovided with land may
have a grant in his other island of Antigua.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the abuse heaped upon the vagrant in
his own time and in our own, it is interesting to remember that
he sometimes did something useful when he got the chance.
Even in the days of the Stuarts he and his descendants played
a part in developing the British Empire and in founding the
settlements which led to the existence of the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>f</i>. Pressures
on employers.</div>

<p>But work was also provided for the unemployed by means
of pressure exercised on employers. We have
already seen how both in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the Privy Council endeavoured
to compel cloth manufacturers to continue to carry
on their trade, and how cloth merchants were called before the
justices and judges and ordered not to dismiss their men<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Another instance of the same kind of interference occurred soon
after the outbreak of the Civil War. After Bristol was captured
by the Royalists, Prince Rupert endeavoured to relieve
the distress of the time by ordering the clothiers to keep their
workpeople employed for one month at least<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>.</p>

<p>In another case we can see the justices exercising pressure
on particular individuals not because of a fluctuation of trade,
but in order to carry out the ordinary provisions of the poor
law. Hitchen was the centre of an agricultural district, there
was no manufacture in which men could be employed: wages
were very low and many were out of work. The justices therefore
ordered the "richer sort" to give employment, but they
thereby only occasioned complaints, for in this part of the
country there seems to have been a permanent difficulty in
finding work for the poor<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>.</p>

<p>At other times municipal rulers exerted their influence
in favour of the inhabitants of a particular town. Thus in
1623 at Reading certain poor complained; the clothiers were
warned to appear and thirty of them came to the Guildhall.
It was arranged that two clothiers should be appointed to consult
with the overseers and see that the poor were set to work.
However the complaints still continued, and both at this time
and in 1630 the difficulty was met by ordering the clothiers to
have all their work done in the town and not to send it into the
country. The distress at Reading was thus lessened at the
expense of the surrounding district<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.</p>

<p>That the public authorities of state and town thought they
had a right to exercise pressure of this kind is evident, and
many incidental sayings show us that the employers considered
they had a duty in the matter. Thus at Norwich the hosiers,
finding that they cannot sell their stocks, tell the town rulers
that though they have not yet dismissed their men their money
is exhausted and they find it is impossible for them to go on
much longer<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>. They thus intimate that it was their interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>to have dismissed their men sooner but that they held on as
long as they could. In another case an employer writes to
Nicholas about some payment, and hopes he will be used well
by the Council because during a bad time, when most men
stopped work, he continued his manufacture and kept nearly
one thousand people at work, although he lost heavily by so
doing<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>.</p>

<p>All this shows that the employers recognised some sort of
responsibility for the men whom they usually employed. The
continuance of business would save much hardship if the cause
of distress was merely a temporary fluctuation in trade. In
the cloth-manufacture this was often the case, and therefore
the pressure brought to bear on employers in this direction
must be considered a real method of helping the poor.</p>

<p>But there was another way in which pressure was put on
employers. We occasionally find that the town, instead of
providing a stock of materials to set the poor to work, reported
that the inhabitants found employment for them or that the
inhabitants provided hemp and tow and flax and set the poor
to work themselves<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>. This not improbably points to some plan
like that of the roundsman system of later days. A man in
want of work, on applying to the parish authorities, was sent
round to different employers and was set to work by each of
them for a short period. This plan does not seem to have been
much used, for in most cases the justices mention that the
overseers had raised stocks of money in order to provide work
for the ablebodied, and thus imply their intention of giving
direct employment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>g</i>. Advancement
of capital
without
interest.</div>

<p>Perhaps the charity which was most peculiar to the seventeenth
century was that of lending sums of money
to set young tradesmen and artificers up in business
for themselves.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
capital was growing a more and more important factor in pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>duction
and it was becoming an increasingly difficult thing for
the young journeyman to become a master.</p>

<p>We must remember that six to twelve per cent. was the
ordinary rate of interest at the time. The difficulty of paying
so much probably prevented many poor young men from starting
business. Moreover all through the Middle Ages lending
money for interest was considered contrary to Christian
morality, and many men still held to the old opinion. In great
numbers of places therefore funds were bequeathed to what
have been termed "Lending Cash Charities." Sums were lent
to young men, or sometimes to older men who had lost their
capital, either for no return or at what was then a low rate of
interest, and the borrowers had to find security for the repayment
of the original sum. Many of the City Companies are
responsible for the administration of very considerable sums of
this kind. The Haberdashers' Company alone possesses £2510
which ought to be lent gratis and which was bequeathed by
many different donors between the years 1569 and 1638. The
Mercers' Company possesses at least twenty-one gifts of this
kind. One of the most considerable of these is that of Lady
Campbell, who in 1642 bequeathed £1000 which was to be lent
gratis on good security to eight young men of the Mercers'
Company; shopkeepers of the mercery were to be preferred,
and next to them silkmen<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>.</p>

<p>Not only the City Companies but also the town rulers of
most provincial towns and sometimes parish authorities were
trustees for such charities. At Ipswich bequests of this kind
are especially numerous; they are much smaller in amount than
those of London, but they are typical of the kind of charity that
once existed in almost every town in which old records remain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>In common with twenty-three other towns, Ipswich had an
interest in Sir Thomas White's will and received in its turn
£100 to be lent to four poor tradesmen. Besides this no less
than eleven other legacies of this sort were received before
1635. Amongst these Mrs Alice Scrivener gave £100 to be
lent gratis to ten people for four years, Christopher Cock gave
£100 to be lent to four clothiers for five years, and John Barrett
£20 to four shoemakers without interest<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. At Reading the same
kind of thing was done; in 1626 Mr Ironside left £100 to be
lent gratis to two clothiers and two shopkeepers, and in 1633
Richard Johnson gave £100 for four tradesmen for twelve
years<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>. At Oxford there were once many sums for such loans,
but these have most of them either been lost or are used for
other purposes<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>.</p>

<p>In Barnstaple, Bristol, Newbury, Lichfield, Wolverhampton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>and Colchester<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> there were similar bequests, and apparently in
most towns charitable funds of this kind were in existence
during the reigns of the earlier Stuarts. It was one of the
ways in which the philanthropists of the time endeavoured
to give employment, only in this case it was not to the
vagrant, but to the householder or skilled workman. Usually
these sums were given by private people and administered
by the town. But at Hitchin we find something of the kind
suggested as a method of poor relief. The justices in their
report recount the sufferings of the poor during the plague,
and say that "three poore tradesmen who were shutt up
And haue lost their custome and spent their meanes haue
petitioned for stock to put them into Trade againe<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>." The
matter was not yet decided, but from the justices' language it
is clear that they regarded it as quite within their power to
grant relief in this manner. John Lock, tailor of London,
bequeathed gifts of £5 to £10 to the apprentices of Bridewell
with a similar object, and, having regard to the circumstances of
the time, few charities would probably have had a better effect
if they had been honestly administered.</p>

<p>We thus see that many different methods were employed to
relieve the old, to train the young and to give work to the able-bodied.
The examples we have already given afford some
evidence that legal poor relief had become well established in
many districts, but it was not equally well administered at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>times and in all places. We will now inquire when and how
the administration of the law was improved, and the answer
to this question may suggest the reason why the history of the
English Poor Law is different to that of the rest of Western
Europe.</p>

</ul>


<div class="sidenote">1. Importance
of the
period 1597-1644.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright">1. (<i>a</i>) Because
it was
the period
when the relief
of the impotent
poor became
established.</div>

<p>We have already examined both the machinery which
existed for the execution of the poor law and the
different methods which were used for relieving
the impotent, for training the young and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
providing work for the unemployed. We have
now to consider the administration as a whole; to
find out when and where the machinery was put
in motion and how far these methods were
generally employed. The history of poor relief in the sixteenth
century has already shown us that it was far more easy to pass
a Poor Law than to procure a good system of administration.
There were many poor laws before those of 1597 and 1601 but
they were not well administered: they were never so generally
or so effectively enforced as to become part of the practice as
well as of the law of the country.</p>

<p>If the last Elizabethan poor law had been no more successful
than these earlier statutes the whole system of compulsory
poor relief would probably have collapsed during the Civil
War. The fact that the part of the poor law relating to
children and the destitute survived that war, and has ever
since formed part of our social organisation may be attributed
therefore to the improved administration of the earlier Stuarts.
The administrators of this period are thus responsible for the
continued practice of any legal system of relief at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. (<i>b</i>) The
period 1597 to
1644 is also the
only period in
which many
efforts were
made to set
the unemployed
to work.</div>

<p>But the history of administration during this period is important
for a second reason. The part of the poor law
relating to the impotent poor and children has been
enforced ever since the reign of Charles I., but the
clauses relating to the unemployed were very little
executed after the Civil War. In 1662 the destitute
were relieved, but the unemployed were no longer
set to work. In this respect therefore the poor law administration
of the reigns of the earlier Stuarts is unique. It is interesting
therefore to examine the methods then employed a little
more closely and see if the instances of the provision of work
which we have already considered are isolated cases of this kind
of relief or if they are examples of a general system. If the unemployed
were at all generally set to work, then this period is important,
not only because the legal relief of the destitute then
became the practice of the country, but because we then had more
poor relief than we have ever had before or since. For a short
time a limited kind of socialism was to some extent established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>We will therefore now try to find out how the events of
the period throw light on these two points; (1) when and how
was the system of poor relief thoroughly established, and
(2) how far was that part of it which concerned the employment
of the poor ever an important part of the social organisation of
the country.</p>

<p>The two parts of our inquiry are much intermingled, and
it is impossible to separate them entirely. But in the first
part we will consider the system of poor relief as a whole
including the finding of work for the unemployed when it is
closely associated with the other portions of the system, and we
will afterwards examine more in detail a few points which
especially concern the provision of work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. The administration
of
the law in the
North and
extreme West
was negligent.</div>

<p>With regard to the relief of the poor as a whole, it seems
clear that the law was not equally well administered
at all places or in all times. The places in
which the administration of the law was least
satisfactory were those farthest from the seat of
government. They are indicated in some cases by the absence
of justices' reports; in others by the character of the reports,
or by the distinct statement of the statute of 1662. From
Northumberland and Cumberland and some of the counties of
Wales we have no justices' reports on the poor law, and we
have little evidence from other sources as to any effective
enforcement of the law. From Westmoreland and Lancashire
we have very few reports until 1637 and 1638, and these seem
to indicate that the system of poor relief was then only
recently introduced<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>. From Wiltshire, Devonshire and Cornwall
we have a few reports, but they indicate a comparatively careless
administration. There are few or no cases of setting the
poor to work, and in Wiltshire it was difficult to find masters
for the apprentices. But except in Northumberland and
Cumberland some kind of legal poor relief was administered
in all these counties, although it seems to have been less well
administered than in other parts of the country. The statute
of 1662 tells us that at the time of its enactment parts of
Wales, the counties forming the Bishopric of Durham and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>county of Yorkshire derived little benefit from the statute of
Elizabeth<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>, and except Yorkshire, these counties are precisely
those from which we have few or no reports.</p>

<p>But in the South-east and Midland parts of England and
the rest of the Western shires the case was different. During
some part of our period the system seems to have been on the
whole fairly well organised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. The administration
of
the Poor Law
in the rest of
England
depended
upon the
action of the
Privy Council.</div>

<p>But this was not equally the case at all times. It was the
case only when the justices were vigilant, and
they seem to have been made vigilant mainly
by the frequent letters and orders of the Privy
Council.</p>

<p>It is this action of the Privy Council that
seems to make the administration of this period
different from that of the sixteenth century, though it was the
existence of the justices that caused this action to be so
effectual. But the letters and orders of the Privy Council
were not always equally frequent even during the period from
1597 to 1644.</p>

<p>We have already seen that in 1597 a letter ordering the
good execution of the new poor law was sent to all the justices
of England and Wales. We have also seen that between 1597
and 1629 this kind of action was exceptional. The Council
interfered in particular cases, and in times of scarcity commanded
general measures of relief, but before 1629 it did not
steadily enforce the administration of general measures with
regard to the relief of the poor in ordinary times. But from
1629 to 1640 we find that the matter is altogether different;
a commission is appointed, a new organisation is introduced by
the Book of Orders of 1630/1, and for nine years the pressure of
the Council on the justices is constant and continuous. We
have now to see if the improvement in the general administration
of the poor law in all parts of the country corresponded
to the periods when the Privy Council was vigorous. We will
consider first the period between 1597 and 1605, secondly that
from 1605 to 1629, and lastly the years from 1629 to 1640.
We shall find that there are grounds for believing that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>administration of the system of poor relief was best when
most pressure was exercised and was lax when pressure was
withdrawn. The main improvement therefore in the organisation
of the system took place between 1629 and 1640, that is
under the personal government of Charles I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Action
of Privy
Council and
administration
between 1597
and 1605.</div>

<p>The directions of the Privy Council in 1597 seem to have
had an immediate effect both as regards measures
of relief and measures of repression.</p>

<p>As regards the repressive measures and the
efficacy of Houses of Correction the opinion of
Lord Coke is decisive. He had many opportunities of knowledge
and had no reason for not being impartial. Speaking of
the employment and correction of vagrants he says, "And this
excellent work is without question feasible. For, upon the
making of the statute of 39 Eliz. and a good space after
whilest Justices of the Peace and other officers were diligent
and industrious there was not a rogue to be seen in any part
of England, but when Justices and other Officers became
tepidi or trepidi Rogues etc. swarmed again." Speaking of
gaols and Houses of Correction he tells us, "Few or none are
committed to the common gaol amongst so many malefactors
but they come out worse then they went in. And few are
committed to the House of Correction or Working-House, but
they come out better<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>." For a little time therefore vagrants
were repressed, and the discipline and relief afforded in Houses
of Correction were very efficacious.</p>

<p>There was also an improvement with regard to the administration
of relief to the more deserving classes of the poor. We
have already seen that special energy was displayed in the
West Riding of Yorkshire at this time, and that there the
justices found it very difficult to administer the law, but did
execute it to a considerable extent. In Devonshire also the
justices received a letter from the Lord Lieutenant, urging
them to take especial care for the relief of those in want, and
they too began to take measures for carrying out the law.
They revoked the licenses granted for beggars, put in order the
Houses of Correction and authorised a system of organised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>billeting on the rich. The poor were to be relieved with two
meals a day, one to every household or two or more according
to the ability of the householder. If there was any default the
justices might assess any sum up to eighteenpence weekly
"for every pole<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>." Moreover the justices were to raise stocks
for setting the poor to work. All this points to a great increase
in vigilance after the Order in Council of 1597 and it also
points to the fact that the administration was recent. A
general system of billeting was seldom adopted when the legal
relief of the poor had been long put in practice. Moreover
Devonshire and Yorkshire in later times were backward in
administering the law, so that the improvement was probably at
least as great in other counties.</p>

<p>We should also derive a favourable opinion as to the good
execution of the law at that time from the Duke of Stettin's
account of his journey through England in 1602. Speaking of
the Royal Exchange he states, "It is a pleasure to go about
there, for one is not molested or accosted by beggars, who are
elsewhere so frequently met with in places of this kind. For
in all England they do not suffer any beggars except they be
few in number and outside the gates.</p>

<p>"Every parish cares for its own poor, strangers are brought
to the hospital, but those that belong to the kingdom or have
come from distant places are sent from one parish to the other,
their wants being cared for until at last they reach their home<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>."
The Duke of Stettin judges favourably most things that he
sees in England but still his account could not have been
written unless beggars had been out of sight in the parts
visited by him and unless the poor had seemed to be relieved
in England more effectually than in his own country.</p>

<p>After 1597 therefore the execution of the law appears to
have been more vigorous and the improvement is likely to have
been connected with the action taken by the Privy Council in
that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">5. Action of
the Privy
Council and
administration
between 1605
and 1629.</div>

<p>We will now see how the administration of poor relief was
carried out between 1605 and 1629. We know
that during these years the Privy Council did not
make continuous efforts on behalf of the deserving
poor. A commission however was contemplated
in January 1619/20, and the special measures in connection with
the years of scarcity of 1621 to 1623 were much more organised
than in former years, and may have suggested an improved
administration of the law about that time. We therefore
find that on the whole the law appears to have been badly
executed but that from 1621 to 1623 some improvement took
place.</p>

<p>We will first see what are the grounds for thinking the law
was badly executed between 1605 and 1629.</p>

<p>Lord Coke himself tells us "rogues soon swarmed again"
and his opinion is confirmed by the evidence of a tract of this
time called "Stanleyes Remedy or the VVay how to reform
wandring Beggers, Theeves, high-way Robbers and Pickpockets."</p>

<p>This pamphlet was not published until 1646 but seems to
have been composed about the year 1606<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. The writer is a
converted highwayman who is anxious for the reformation of
his fellow-sinners. He states "that Beggerie and Theeverie
did never more abound," and he complains that the branding
and whipping parts of the statutes are put in execution long
before any place is provided where the poor could have work.
He thought that this was most unfair to the vagrants for many
of them would work if they could and go voluntarily to workhouses
if they were in existence. He therefore urges the establishment
of places where men could have work in all the larger
parishes of the kingdom<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.</p>

<p>Another pamphlet complaining of the bad execution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>law was entitled "Greevous Grones for the Poore" and was
published in 1622. The writer of this states that "though the
number of the Poore do dailie increase all things worketh for
the worst in their behalfe. For there hath beene no collection
for them, no not these seven yeares in many parishes of this
land especiallie in countrie townes; but many of those parishes
turneth forth their Poore, yea and their lustie labourers that
will not worke or for any misdemeenor want worke, to begge,
filtch, and steale, for their maintenance so that the country is
pittifully pestered with them<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>."</p>

<p>Another document of 1624 gives precisely the same information.
This is a letter from a Mr Williamson to Sir Julius
Caesar, the Master of the Rolls, who was one of the most
charitably disposed gentlemen of the time. The writer thinks
the neglect of the overseers to apprentice children is the true
cause of vagrancy. He tells us that the seventeenth century
vagrant like the modern tramp was very seldom a man who
knew a trade<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. The existence of these untrained men was due
to the fault of the administrators of the Poor Law. For
these "intollerable offences haue originally growen from the
Ou(er)seers of the poore who heretofore and att this day haue
and doe so ou(er)see as though they did not see at all<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>."</p>

<p>These writings would therefore lead us to believe that
justices soon grew careless; the poor were not relieved and in
many places there was very little execution of the law at all.
All these statements are made by writers who are vigorously
supporting only one side of the case but the official evidence of
the period confirms their view of the matter. The reasons
given for the appointment of the commission suggested in
1619/20 show that the unofficial writers had not exaggerated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>existing neglect in the administration of the poor laws. Good
laws have been made but they are not executed because
the justices are negligent and the judges of Assize have not
time to fully investigate the matter. The laws in consequence
"are in many partes of our Realme laid aside or little regarded
as lawes not in force or of small consequence, whereas in some
other counties and partes of this kingdome in w<sup>ch</sup> by the diligence
and industrye of sume justices of the peace and other
magistrates the said lawes haue bine dulye putt in execucon
there hath evidentlye appeared much good and benefitt to haue
redowned to the Comon welth by the same<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>." At this time
therefore there was a real likelihood that the poor law would
become obsolete.</p>

<p>However the season of scarcity in 1622-3 was accompanied
by a crisis in the cloth trade and the Privy Council was active
in enforcing measures of relief. A great improvement was
consequently then effected in the execution of temporary
measures of corn relief, and some reports indicate that this was
accompanied by a better administration of the ordinary poor
law also.</p>

<p>Thus from Burnham in Buckinghamshire the justices report,
"We have alsoe looked into and have caused the poore to bee
well provided for in every parrish within this diuision both by
stocks to sett them on worke as alsoe by weekely contributions<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>."
From several of the hundreds of Suffolk there are similar reports.
Thus in every "towne" of Lackford and Exning the rates had
been augmented and the "poorer sorte of people within the
seurall townes and places are ordered to be sett on worke<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>."
From other districts in both East and West we have like
accounts<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the years 1605 and 1629 therefore the administration
of poor relief was on the whole negligent and in many
districts the poor law was already considered to be of little importance.
The government was however still anxious to secure
its enforcement and the measures taken to relieve distress in
1622-3 effected an improvement in a few districts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Action
of the Privy
Council and
administration
between 1629
and 1644.</div>

<p>But from 1629 to 1644 we have a different state of things.
We know already that during this period the
action of the Privy Council was continuous and
constant, and it is in this period therefore that we
shall be able to see how far it was effective. The
justices' reports, to which we have already often referred are the
main sources of our information.</p>

<p>We will endeavour to see how far the evidence of the early
part of the period confirms the view we have already formed
as to the administration of the law at the beginning of the
time, and we will secondly try to estimate the evidence as to
improvement during this period.</p>

<div class="sidenoteright">6. <i>a.</i> State
of affairs in
1631.</div>

<p>The condition of affairs before 1631 is indicated by the
preamble to the commission of Jan. 1631/2 and by
some of the earlier reports of 1631. The reasons
given for the appointment of the commission of
1631/2 are almost exactly the same as those given in the draft of
1619/20. The justices are said as before to be negligent so that
the laws were almost obsolete in some parts of the country, and
this alone shows that there had been little permanent improvement
since 1620. The preamble also refers to an earlier time
"vpon the present making of the said lawes," when they were
duly executed and thus confirms the evidence as to the good
execution of the laws after 1597<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>.</p>

<p>The justices' reports of 1631 give us more detailed information
of the same kind. One of these was sent from three of
the hundreds of Hampshire, Fawley, Bountisborough and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>Mainsborough. The justices say that they sent an abstract
of the act to the officials concerned and ordered constables,
tithingmen, and overseers to bring presentments to them. But
they "for the most parte" replied, "that they haue noe poore
that wanted worke or releife, that they had noe rogues but suche
as were punished." The justices thought this state of things
too good to be true; they made further enquiries and found
that the highways were out of repair, that no monthly meetings
had been held by the overseers and that there were no stocks
for setting the poor to work. They also heard that some of the
poor were "in noe small want" but did not complain because of
ignorance or fear. They hoped to effect improvement by
exacting fines for negligence, by publishing the particulars of
their monthly meetings, and by sending a series of definite
questions to the overseers as to the names of the poor relieved
or set to work and of the children over ten years of age who
were not bound apprentice<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>. In this way they tried to obtain
detailed statements so that there could be no evasion of the
law. There is a later report from Fawley concerning corn and
apprentices, and the part of the law relating to apprentices was
certainly then carried out<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.</p>

<p>But there are other districts in which the justices do not
tell us of negligent officials, but rather seem proud of their
vigour and yet seem to imply that it was only recently the law
had come into force. This is particularly the case in Radnorshire
and Cheshire. In two divisions of Radnor the justices
say they have appointed overseers, and have given particular
directions as to the provision of stocks and return of the names
of the poor relieved<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. The reports suggest that the justices
were now energetic, but that little had been done before; the
mention of the appointment of overseers is unaccompanied by
the word new or by any statement as to the rendering of the
accounts of the old overseers, so that it is possible that these
were the first overseers appointed in that district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>In two of the divisions of Cheshire the same state of things
is implied more definitely. The justices say that they have
ordered the collection of a stock for the setting the poor to
work and for the relief of the impotent, but they find the
people poor and averse to paying money for any purpose of
the kind. They fear some time will elapse before these orders
can be properly executed. At present these divisions have not
got a House of Correction, and the justices wish to have one
in the Castle in order that they may be able to subdue the
people to subjection<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>. These reports seem to reveal a very
primitive state of things, and recall the difficulties in the West
Riding of Yorkshire in 1597, when poor relief seems to have
been first enforced there, and the people greatly objected to
the imposition of rates.</p>

<p>Other reports show that the Book of Orders strengthened
the hands of reformers; thus in the town of Wells, charities
had been negligently administered, but after the issue of the
orders the Recorder was able to procure information formerly
withheld, and hoped to effect farther improvement by obtaining
a commission of charitable uses<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>.</p>

<p>It is thus fairly clear that before 1631 the law had not been
well administered. We will now examine the evidence as to
the improvement between 1631 and 1640.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. <i>b.</i> Improvement
effected in
1631 and 1632.</div>

<p>The greater number of the reports of 1631 and 1632 point
to some execution of the law before 1631 and
suggest improvement rather than entire innovation.
The justices generally state they have
"raised rates" or have bound many more children apprentices
or that stocks had been provided in the parishes where there
were none before. Two reports enable us to trace the process
of improvement in detail, and seem to throw considerable light
on the general statements of other documents of the kind.
They do not however present so favourable a view as to the
execution of the law as most of the other returns. These
reports relate to the district of Braughing in Hertfordshire.
The overseers of thirteen places in the half hundred of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Braughing made returns to the justices at six successive
monthly meetings held in accordance with the provisions of
the Book of Orders, between Feb. 7th and June 27, 1631.
Abstracts of these returns were sent in by the justices in two
documents, one of which was forwarded in April and the other
in July 1631<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>. We can thus see exactly when the improvement
was effected. At the first meeting four parishes provided
corn at reduced rates for the poor. The Book of Orders
relating to scarcity had been issued since September, and we
should expect some improvement would already have been
made. Six sets of overseers had already placed some children
apprentices, but not very many, and only two of the largest
places had stocks for setting the poor to work. At the last
meeting on June 27th relief was much more extensively
administered. Two other places provided corn at reduced
rates: the six parishes which formerly had placed a few apprentices
now bound many more, while five other townships
also provided for the children in this manner. A much better
provision for the employment of the poor was also made. In
five places instead of two there were now stocks for this
purpose and most of the others give reasons for the want of
one. In three cases we are told there is plenty of employment,
at Eastwick the inhabitants set the poor to work, and
at Westmill the general statement only is made that the
poor are relieved according to their necessities. Three places
do not provide stocks or give any reason for not doing so.
We can also see that these funds might often have disappeared,
for the ten pounds stock at Hunsdon had "decayed" to
only five pounds at the end of the period. In the district of
Braughing therefore the law was executed in the larger places
before 1630 but negligently even there. Immediately however
after the receipt of the Book of Orders the justices set themselves
to work, held the monthly meetings, stimulated the
overseers, and in five months succeeded in effecting a very considerable
improvement.</p>

<p>This was only typical of what was going on all over the
country. It is of course impossible to quote all the reports of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>the period; it is only possible to give particular cases, and to
state that they are not isolated instances, but are typical of the
documents of that time. Thus in April, 1631, we hear that
meetings had been rapidly held and that they had been
partially successful, but that the justices were still in the midst
of their activity; they had done a good deal to make matters
better and were still doing more. For example in the account
sent from the New Forest the justices write "the rates for the
poore where neede most requireth wee haue caused to be rised
for reliefe of the poore people w<sup>th</sup>in that part, and haue given
strict order to the ouerseers for providing necessary releife for
such as are ympotent and such as are able to sett them to
worke, and haue alreadie placed many poore children apprentizes
and doe proceede in placinge of more<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>."</p>

<p>In the returns sent later in the year the organisation
appears to be more settled and we hear that not only the rates
are raised but that they have had a good effect. Thus in
Monslow in Shropshire the justices state "and as for the late
booke of orders for the reliefe of the poore and the punishing of
rogues and vagabonds wee have had severalle monthlye meetings
in the said hundred and wee have long since worked such
effect thereby as they have not any rogues or vagabonds
appeared amongst vs or walked abroade as wee can heare of
since our first meetings, and the impotent poore are relieved in
such sort by their parishoners as wee have noe complaints and
there are stocks in all parishes more or lesse as the charge of
the parishes require to set the able poore on worke<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>." Not all
the reports are as favourable as this, but on the whole they
indicate that improved order followed the execution of the
Book of Orders. It thus is clear that the Orders of 1631 had a
very considerable immediate effect both in bringing the law
into operation in places where it had been almost or altogether
neglected and still more in improving the administration in
those districts in which the system was already to some extent
administered though not yet effectually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">6. <i>c.</i> Improvement
maintained
between 1631
and 1640.</div>

<p>We have now to see whether this improved administration
was maintained. The reports are certainly less
frequent after 1631 but those that remain shew
that the efficiency is preserved and there is much
to indicate a farther improvement.</p>

<p>We will first examine a few documents which seem to indicate
that the area of administration was extending into backward
districts, we will then investigate a few cases in which we
have reports both in 1631 and in 1638 or 1639, and we will
lastly consider a special department of the poor law system,
namely the placing of apprentices.</p>

<p>We have already noted the fact that in the earlier years of
the period there were few reports from Westmoreland and
Lancashire.</p>

<p>But in 1638 there are a series of documents from Westmoreland<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
and several reports from Lancashire. In 1638 some of the
Lancashire parishes adopted the system of billeting the poor
in need of relief on the richer inhabitants. This plan does not
seem to have long continued as an exclusive system of relief,
and the facts that it was still employed and that these are the
earliest reports from Westmoreland seem to indicate that a
compulsory system of poor relief had only lately been established
in the northern counties. Moreover in 1637 we are told
that at the meeting of the justices in Rochdale in Sept. 1637,
the churchwardens of Middleton confessed that they had never
before levied a tax for the relief of the poor there; they now
however proceeded to levy one, and in March in the following year
the tax provided the necessary relief<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>. All this seems to show
that the area of the administration of the poor law was extending
and that in 1638 there was little danger of the system of
poor relief becoming obsolete but that it was obtaining a firmer
hold over the country.</p>

<p>We will now examine a few of the cases in which we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>reports from the same district both in 1631 and 1638 or 1639.
We have already noted the detailed returns from Braughing.
It happens that one of the latest documents of the series
returned in August 1639 comes from the hundreds of Hertford
and Braughing. The justices tell us that our "ympotent
poore are weekelie releiued by a certein pencon and the rates
increased as necessitie requires. And those of able bodies are
plentifullie stored with work for the maynteynance of their
families"; five apprentices had also lately been bound<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>. From
this we see that the improved administration there lasted
throughout the period.</p>

<p>We have several other places from which we have similar
reports. Skenfreth, one of the hundreds of Monmouth, often
sent accounts of the proceedings of the justices. One belongs
to May, 1631. The justices state some of the things they did
both before the Commission and afterwards. Before the Commission
they provided weekly stipends for all the aged and
impotent people, "sithence the said commission" they "have
taken order that the same stipends shalbe contineually paied
soe that none of any such poore people have made any complaint
unto us for any mainetenance." Both before and after
the commission they had punished rogues and since they had
also placed apprentices and suppressed alehouses. Moreover
the highways had been last year in better condition than for
twenty years before<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the immediate improvement effected by the commission
was that the pensions were paid as well as ordered,
apprentices were bound and alehouses suppressed.</p>

<p>In May, 1637, we have a report from the same district
together with the hundreds of Ragland and Trellech. At that
time apprentices were bound, rogues punished and efforts made
to secure the observance of fasting days. The justices have
also "taken course for provision of stock to sett the poore on
worke," and have "caused to be sufficiently relieved all the aged
lame and ympotent people<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>." Thus if these documents are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>be believed the improvement effected in 1631 was maintained
and even increased in this hundred of Skenfreth.</p>

<p>There are many other cases in which reports are sent in
several times from the same place and all show that the improvement
made in 1631 was continued in 1637, 1638 or 1639<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>.</p>

<p>We will now examine a few of the reports which relate
especially to the placing of apprentices. Before May 1635 the
Privy Council or the commissioners seem to have urged the
justices to see especially that this part of the law was carried
out, and to have asked them to report the names of the apprentices
and those of their masters<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>. The reports sent in 1634
and 1635 therefore relate especially to the placing of apprentices
and the monthly meetings of the justices.</p>

<p>Reports from twenty-one places were sent in between July
17th and July 31st, 1634. In almost every case the justices expressly
state that they hold monthly meetings and bind poor
children apprentice<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>. In the year 1635 the statements are more
detailed. Between May 20th and May 30th replies were sent
from ten places in eight of which the names of both apprentices
and masters were given<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>. Sometimes these were numerous; thus
at Blandford in Dorset one hundred and nineteen apprentices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>were bound in the course of two years<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>; in one district of
Somerset the names of one hundred and sixty-six are returned<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>,
while in all ten districts a fair amount of work was done. Thus
in 1634 and 1635 apprenticeship was more insisted upon than
other methods of poor relief and it seems to have been very
generally well administered. We hear of some complaints but
not many in proportion to the number of reports.</p>

<p>We thus see that during the years 1630 to 1639 we have a
large amount of information concerning the administration of
the Poor Law. We find that a great improvement was effected
in 1631. We also find that the area of administration continued
to extend into the Northern counties after 1631: the
difference is indicated by the fact that in 1638 it is exceptional
to find a place without a poor rate, whereas in 1631 the
Government spoke of the laws as being almost obsolete in many
places. We see further that sometimes the later reports come
from the same places as the earlier, and that then the administration
continues to be reported as good. Lastly, in regard to
apprentices we are told that the Privy Council made special
efforts to enforce the law, and that all over the country there is
evidence that it was enforced though occasionally without
favourable results. There is thus reason to believe that the
efforts made by the central government to enforce the law were
at last successful, and that the period to which we owe the survival
of our English system of poor relief is that of the personal
government of Charles I.</p>

<p>But we have already noticed that not only is this period the
critical time in the history of the poor relief that survived, but
in one respect the poor relief of this period was unique. Many
efforts were made to find work for the unemployed. Relief of
this kind was so much a part of the general system of the time
that we have already examined many instances in which it was
administered.</p>

<p>We will first investigate a few more of the reports of 1631,
and we shall find that the improvement effected in all parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>the administration of poor relief especially concerned the relief
of the ablebodied; we will then examine a detailed report in
order to see what light it throws on the interpretation of the
general statements of other justices, and we will lastly try to
find out if relief of this kind was confined to a few districts, or
was administered all over the country, and also in what parts of
the country there was the greatest need of employment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. The improvement
effected in 1631
especially concerned
the
unemployed.</div>

<p>To begin with cases in which improvement was reported in
April 1631. From a large district of Hertfordshire
we hear "we haue already raysed a stocke in some
parishes, and are raysing stocks for the rest to
sett all the poore on worke in this division<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>." In
Essex, Richmond, Bedford and Beverley fresh taxes for this
purpose had just been raised, and at Agbrigg they were still
"setlinge such a course for raysinge of stocke to sett y<sup>e</sup> people
of able bodies on work<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>."</p>

<p>At Winchester the same thing is implied: the stock has
been put in a clothier's hands, so that now the poor do not
want work<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>. Twenty-eight reports relating not only to
measures for corn, but also for the poor were sent in between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>April 21st and April 30th 1631. In seventeen of these the
poor were set to work, and in many cases we can see that the
measures have been taken since the receipt of the Book of
Orders of January 1631/2<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.</p>

<p>In the answers sent in May we have the same kind of
information. In Brixton and Wallington we have a report
similar to that from Hertfordshire; "stockes of mony," we are
told, "are raised in moste of the parishes w<sup>th</sup>in the said hundrede
and burrow and the reste not yet raised are w<sup>th</sup> as much expedicon
as may bee to bee raised for buyinge of flax, hempe
and other materialls to set the poore to worke<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>." From
Arundel there is a like account, "we haue caused the taxations
for the releefe of the poor to be raised in euery parish in this
time of scarsitye, and haue likewise caused stocks of mony to
be raised in euery parish to buy materialls to sett the poor a
warke, and we haue caused the Statute of Laborors to be
inquired after and to be putt in execution<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>."</p>

<p>We can thus see that in 1631 the justices were busy raising
stocks to provide work for the poor, and that in seventeen
documents, or more than half of the reports of the last ten days
of April 1631, we are informed that measures had been taken
with this object.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. The
detailed
report from
Bassetlaw
throws light
upon the more
general
statements
of the
justices.</div>

<p>We will now examine a more detailed report relating to
sixty parishes of Bassetlaw in County Nottingham
and sent in during March 1636/7<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. In most cases
information is given under four headings, first we
are told how many of the impotent poor are
relieved, secondly the amount of the town stock,
thirdly how many rogues have been punished, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>lastly how many apprentices have been bound. This document
is important because it seems to indicate the number of
parochial officials who provided work for the unemployed in
the district of Bassetlaw. This is not directly stated in the
report, but the overseers return the amount of the town stock
of their parish whenever a town stock existed. From the
method in which the return is made it seems that this town
stock was always used for finding employment for the able-bodied
poor<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>. Other methods of dealing with those out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>work are also noted, so that it appears that in forty-five out of
sixty parishes the parochial authorities provided employment
for those poor who could work. The amount of the stock was
often quite small; in one case only sixteen shillings, but it is
very possible that in this instance the parish also was small;
in another place the stock consisted of a sum of about thirty
pounds, and the average amount was about three pounds. This
document from Bassetlaw only states in detail what many of
the other reports imply, but the detail is much more convincing,
and it is confirmed by the overseers' accounts from Barnet and
Elstree which we have already examined<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>. It is perhaps
worth while to notice that as early as 1623 the justices wrote
from Bassetlaw that work for the poor was wanting, and they
even then ordered that the labourers should be set to work by
the town's stock and the impotent relieved by the public contribution<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9. Local
variations in
the provision
for the unemployed.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright"><i>a.</i> Not so
extensive in
the parts
North of the
Humber and in
the extreme
West.</div>

<p>We have now to try to find out if it was only in a few
counties that work was found for the unemployed, or
if it was all over England. We have already noted
that in the counties north of the Humber, and in
the three western counties of Devonshire, Cornwall,
and Wiltshire the poor law was apparently
less well administered than in other parts of the
country. In these counties with the exception of
Yorkshire therefore there are few instances in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>which stocks are found for providing work for the unemployed.
We hear however that in Ashton-under-Line there existed a
"small stocke of money which is disposed on for the setting of
poore to worke<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>". Moreover, in two Yorkshire reports of 1635
it is stated that the justices have been "verie carefull to raise
stockes for setting ou<sup>r</sup> poore on worke<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>." There are other
Yorkshire returns containing information of the same kind, but
still the plan of finding work for the unemployed of the North
seems to be comparatively unusual.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>But with regard to the rest of England this is not the case.
In every county except Northampton some justices state that
they have found employment for the poor. As we might
expect this was done most frequently in the towns and in the
manufacturing counties, both because in these places there
were more rich people and because there were also more unemployed
owing to the greater fluctuations of trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9 <i>b</i>. Provision
of work more
necessary in
the towns
than in the
country.</div>

<p>A report from Reading and Theale illustrates this: "Wee
finde that the able poore in boddy to worke
and w<sup>ch</sup> are in country villages and hambletts haue
theire ymploymt in husbondrie and by that meanes
are mayntayned; other lyen in such countrie
townes, populer, incorporate, where heretofore multitudes of
such able persons haue lived by worke from the clothier, now
through the defect and decaye of that trade and soe consequently
of the clothier, thousands of these poore formerlie
relieved by worke liue in much want and could hardlie subsist
this deere yeare did not many extend theire charity even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>beyond their meanes<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>." Newbury and Abingdon were also
towns in the same neighbourhood subject to similar conditions,
and we know already that workhouses were founded in both
these places and in Reading itself also<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. Shrewsbury and Hereford
are fair examples of more westernly towns. At Shrewsbury
the justices report in June 1631 that they "are aboute a course
to sett all the poore on worke within our Towne and Libertyes<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>,"
and in 1638 an order was made for regulating a workhouse
there<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>. About the same time the Mayor of Hereford records
that "there is a colleccon made in euerie severall parish w<sup>th</sup>in
the said Cyttie, and competent somes raysed for to releive the
impotent and needy, and a stocke for the setting of poore able
people to worke and for the placeing of youth apprentices<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Other magistrates report in like manner: thus in the rape of
Hastings they have caused the officers "as much as in them lyeth
to see the said poore inhabitants bee duely kept to worke and
haue fitting materialls provided for them<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>." In the hundred of
Hertford the justices state in 1631 that the more populous places
have already raised stocks of money to set the poor to work,
and that they are still trying to induce all the others to do
so though a few are not rich enough to bear the necessary taxation<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.
From St Albans, Reigate, Ipswich, Maidstone, Lynn, and
Norwich, as well as from more inland towns we have similar
information: the magistrates of Bedford write that "we haue
raysed divers extraordenary taxes for the reliefe of our poore
and settinge them on worke and therby they are set to worke<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>."
But perhaps the Buckingham report indicates the most thorough
organisation. There the poor had been visited apparently in
the same way as at Norwich. Five hundred people were
examined; the age and occupation of each were noted, and
whether they had work or not. Afterwards employment was
provided for those who needed it and we are told that the poor
"of good disposicon are glad they are thus settled w<sup>th</sup>out
begging and settle themselves seriouslie to their labo<sup>r</sup>." This
good result however was not obtained without complaints from
the ratepayers<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<p>In the country districts also employment seems to have
been provided as well as in the towns whenever the poor
suffered much from the want of work. In the western counties,
however, there were few complaints of lack of employment, except
from the cloth-workers when the trade in cloth was slack.
Some justices expressly state that there is no want of work in
their part of the country. Thus from a large district of
Somerset we hear that there are "none lefte unplaced but
such as doe mainetaine their charge by their labor<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>." There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>fore,
as we should expect, in many reports from the West
nothing is said about finding employment for the able-bodied
poor. There are, however, also a fair number of cases in which
work is said to be provided. This is especially the case in the
counties of Shropshire and Stafford; thus from Staffordshire
three reports were sent in 1634, and in all three we are told
that the poor were set to work<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>. Moreover, the Worcester
justices write that "wee are carefull ... that the able poore bee
well provided of worke<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>" and in almost all<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> the other western
counties, at least one instance of the kind is reported<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">(<i>d</i>) Provision
of work
in many districts
in most
counties of the
east.</div>

<p>But in the east and south-east there was at any rate sometimes
a chronic want of employment, and consequently
numerous efforts to provide for the able-bodied
poor. In the country round Hitchen we
are told, as in the Reading district, that it is the
poor in the town that are distressed, but in the hamlets the
farmers find work for the inhabitants. The justices say they
have no manufacture, and they do not know how to find a
remedy for the people in the town. At one time they make
the richer people employ the poor, but they do not find the
experiment successful<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>. We have also an account of a permanent
want of employment in a large district of Norfolk. In
the hundreds of South Greenhoe, Wayland, and Grimshoe provision
had been made by raising a stock to set the able-bodied
poor to work, and besides the magistrates write, "Wee have
manie young people w<sup>ch</sup> live out of service by reason of the
multitude of them, there not being services for them, but worke
is provided for them in their seuerall parishes<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>."</p>

<p>There are very many reports of stocks for the provision of
work in other country districts of the east. In Hertfordshire,
Suffolk, Norfolk, and Cambridge there is much to make us
think the system was nearly general<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, and in each of the other
eastern counties there are many cases of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>In a district of Middlesex the unemployed were sent to fight
for Gustavus Adolphus<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>, but in most parishes materials were
provided for them to work up. Thus in several hundreds in
Kent "stocks of materialls" were provided in every parish<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>; in
Nottinghamshire those out of service and able to work were set
to work "on the towne stock<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>," while at Horncastle sessions, in
Lincolnshire, the justices take "special care ... that the abler
sort bee constantly sett on worke by the stocke of the parishe<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>Sometimes the sum expended was very considerable if we take
into account the great difference in the value of money. Thus
in Wallington, Surrey, more than £120 was used for providing
work, while nearly fifty pounds remained in hand<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>. On the
whole therefore in the eastern counties, between 1631 and 1640,
it seems that considerable sums of money were raised and
employed in most districts<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> with the object of setting to work
the able-bodied poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10. Summary.</div>

<p>We have thus seen that in 1631 the improvement in the
administration of poor relief concerned especially
the relief of the able-bodied poor, and we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>noted many instances in which taxes were raised for this purpose
at that time. We have also examined a detailed report
from a particular district in the county of Nottingham in which
in forty-five out of sixty parishes some provision seems to
have been made for finding employment for the poor. Moreover,
we find that the plan of providing work for the unemployed
was reported from some district of every county south
of the Humber except Cornwall, Northampton, Devon, and
Wilts; and in Devon and Wilts also the same plan was tried,
although no report of the justices has been preserved. This
form of poor relief thus seems to have been frequently in use
in the towns of both east and west, and in the country districts
of the eastern counties also. It was not quite so general in the
country districts of the west, but still was not infrequent even
there.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, say that from 1631 to 1640 we had
more poor relief in England than we ever had before or since.
We shall try to estimate later how far this system was successful.
But we will now see what happened to the organisation
of English poor relief during the Civil War. We will
also trace the history of poor relief in France and Scotland
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in order that
we may see that the history of poor relief in England is
unique.</p>

<p>The histories of poor relief in England after the Civil War,
and in France and in Scotland throughout the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, both compare and contrast with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
history of English poor relief in the period from 1529 to 1644.
While in each of these cases like circumstances produced similar
attempts to afford relief, in none did both an energetic Privy
Council and a vigorous system of local officials coexist, and
consequently in each case poor laws were in existence but
were badly administered. The course of events in all these
instances will therefore confirm the view that the survival of
the English system of poor relief is owing to the organisation
which was enforced by the English justices and was created by
the Book of Orders of 1631.</p>

<p>In England the justices' reports concerning the administration
of the poor cease after the year 1639. After that date
either no more reports were sent or no care was taken to preserve
them. The cessation of these documents probably marks the
time when the system created by the Book of Orders began to
disappear. Other and more pressing matters engaged the
attention of the Privy Council, and were subjects for the special
inquiries of the judges of assize. The justices devoted their
zeal and attention to raising troops or to meeting the great
demands in money made by both King and Parliament, while
constables and overseers were used as collectors, not only of
funds for the relief of the poor, but also of the revenues needed
by the armies<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. Under these circumstances the system created
by the Book of Orders fell to pieces, and the whole administration
of poor relief became lax. Still the effect of the
execution of the Book of Orders remained. For nine years the
overseers had been drilled by the justices, and the parishioners
had been compelled to pay rates. The inhabitants had become
accustomed to the organisation, and that part of it continued
which was most easily enforced by the overseers, and which
seemed to them most urgently necessary. The impotent were
still relieved, and children were still apprenticed, though less
efficiently than before, but the able-bodied poor were no longer
found with work, except in a few isolated cases.</p>

<p>We will first examine part of the evidence bearing upon the
lax administration of the whole system of poor relief and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>of the efforts which were made under the Commonwealth to
restore the old state of things. Sometimes we hear of the disorganisation
of semi-voluntary charities; at other times of the
bad administration of the laws for the poor; occasionally of
fraudulent practices in connection with charitable endowments.</p>

Relief in England

<i>a.</i> Decline of
charitable institutions.</div>

<p>The four royal hospitals of London are the most conspicuous
instances of charities which were under public
management, but only partly supported by public
contributions. We get from them several complaints
of a partial break-down owing to the Civil
War, and the figures furnished by the Governors
speak for themselves. In 1641 there were over
nine hundred children in Christ's Hospital, in 1647 there were
only five hundred and ninety-seven; at Thomas's Hospital, in
1641, over a thousand patients were relieved, and in 1647 only
six hundred and eighty-two; at St Bartholomew's and Bridewell
the numbers had also decreased<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>. The Governors of
Christ's Hospital give us their estimate of the reasons for this.
We are told that "in respect of the troubles of the times, the
meanes of the said Hospital hath very much failed for want of
charitable Benevolences which formerly have beene given, and
are now ceased; and very few legacies are now given to
hospitals, the rents and revenues thereunto belonging being
also very ill paid by the tenants, who are not able to hold their
leases by reason of their quartering and billetting of soldiers
and the taking away of their corne and cattell from them<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>." A
few years later the billeting had apparently ceased, but the
tenants then suffered "by reason of the severall charges and
taxes laid upon them<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>." Even in 1653 we are informed that
the revenues of Christ's Hospital "hath divers wayes fallen very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>short of means formerly received, viz. heretofore many have
given monies privateley, others very bountifull at their deaths.
And several parishes in London have sent in large contributions
and now but one that sends anything at all<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>." The Civil War
had reduced many of the richer classes to poverty, and probably
most institutions which were maintained by private contributions
would suffer in the same manner as Christ's Hospital in
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <i>b.</i> Neglect
in execution of
ordinary law.</div>

<p>There are also complaints and instances of the bad administration
of the ordinary law. One of these is contained
in the ordinance of the Lords of 1646/7. The
Lord Mayor in the City and the justices and
judges in the country are to put in execution the laws concerning
the poor and rogues, because "by reason of the unhappy
distractions of these times the putting of the Lawes into
execution have been altogether neglected<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>."</p>

<p>Numerous resolutions tell us that the state of the London
streets had become almost unbearable. The vagrants hung on
coaches and begged clamorously at the doors of churches
and private houses<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>: moreover not only did men gather in
tumultuous assemblies "by playing at football or otherwise,"
but many "loose and vagrant persons" also had been found to
wander, who, "under colour of begging in the day time," did
pilfer and steal, and in the night time "did break into houses
and shops to the scandall of the governmente of this City<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1652 several resolutions were passed by Parliament on
the matter, and a committee was appointed to consider how the
poor might be employed, to revive the laws concerning the poor
and setting them to work, and "to consider by what means or
default the same are become ineffectual or are not put in
execution<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>."</p>

<p>These resolutions and these complaints at once show that
the administration had become lax, and that there had formerly
been a time in which these laws had "not become ineffectual,"
and were put in execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1 <i>c</i>. Instances
of corrupt
practices.</div>

<p>There are other cases in which there seems to have been
evidence of corruption. The Chester Hospital, we
are told, had been much neglected<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>; in 1653 we
hear also that persons counterfeited the Letters
Patent and orders of the Council of State for licenses to collect
money for charitable purposes, so that people were cheated, and
it was necessary to pass a special resolution of Parliament on
the subject<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. A curious instance of corruption in the administration
of charitable funds appears at Barnstaple. Many sums
of money had been bequeathed there as elsewhere for the
purpose of enabling a young craftsman or trader to set up business
on his own account. Some time before the war the town
rulers found it difficult to find young men who could furnish
good security, and so lent part of the money to more prosperous
manufacturers, who, they said, set the poor inhabitants to work.
But in 1653 the money was altogether misapplied; the Corporation
bought some gold maces, found they had no funds to pay
for them, and so ordered the debt to be paid with this endowment<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>.
Apparently the money was never paid back, for payments
on account of it cease after this time.</p>

<p>Any one of these instances of fraud and neglect might have
occurred at any time, but so many receive official notice when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>peace was restored that they must have occurred more frequently
during the war than at other times. A letter of this
period seems to indicate the opinion of contemporaries: "You
speak of feasts to relieve the poor, but it is well if the money
left long since for the poor be given to them and not to
feasts<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Attempts
to regain a
good organisation
of poor
relief under
the Commonwealth.</div>

<p>As soon as the Commonwealth was fairly well established
many efforts were made to relieve the poor of
London. As early as 1647 a new organisation
was established, named the Corporation of the
Poor, which was empowered to erect workhouses
and Houses of Correction<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>. Something seems to
have been done by the members of this body. The store-house
situated in the Minories and the Wardrobe-house were granted
to them, and here orphans were maintained and many hundred
of poor families were employed and relieved by the Corporation
by spinning and weaving, "and," they tell us, "whosoever
doth repair, either to the Wardrobe near Blackfriars, or
to Heiden House in the Minories, may have Materials of Flax,
Hemp or Towe to spin at their own houses if it be desired,
leaving so much money as the said Materials cost, until it be
brought again in Yarn; at which time they shall receive money
for their work and more Materials to imploy them; so that a
stock of 12<i>d.</i> or 14<i>d.</i> will be a sufficient security for any that
will be imployed; and every one is paid according to the fineness
or coursness in the Yarn they spin: there being a certain
rule of Length and Tale to pay every one by, so that none
are necessitated to live idly, that are desirous or willing to
work<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>."</p>

<p>But the President and Corporation of the Poor were soon
hindered in their work by want of funds, and were not at all
successful in maintaining order in the London streets<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>greatest difficulty seems to have been in 1656, and they try an
interesting experiment. Many pamphlets of this century concern
the fishing trade and were written to urge the English to
keep it from the Dutch. Some of the writers consider the
fitting out of fishing-boats the best means of setting the poor of
the nation to work<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. The plan now was actually attempted;
three busses or fishing smacks were taken from the Dutch and
granted to this Corporation for the purpose of employing the
poor<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>.</p>

<p>But still the help given was but small; several committees
were appointed by the Council of State, but few decisions were
reached; the measures of relief only concerned London and
not the whole of the country, and even in London comparatively
little was accomplished. In spite of the new orphanage at the
Wardrobe few children were educated there, probably because
no money could be got. The hymn sung by the children implores
Parliament to redress the matter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Grave Senators that sit on high</div>
<div class="verse">Let not poor English Children die</div>
<div class="verse">And droop on Dunghils with lamenting notes;</div>
<div class="verse">An Act for Poor's Relief they say</div>
<div class="verse">Is coming forth; why's this delay?</div>

<div class="verse">Votes<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The work of the Corporation of the Poor continued, but it
never seems to have been great or to have grappled seriously
even with the London poor. In the rest of the country there
was probably the same disorganisation, and less attempt to
remedy matters. At Great Yarmouth the burgesses apparently
thought that the spoils of Norwich Cathedral might be used
for the purpose: they petitioned Parliament to "be pleased to
grant vs such a part of the lead and other vseful materialls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>that vast and altogether vseles Cathedrall in Norwich towardes
building of a works house to employ our almost sterued poore
and repairing our peeres etc.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>"</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Reasons
why disorganisation
especially
affected the
provision of
work for the
unemployed.</div>

<p>There were many reasons why this disorganisation should
especially affect the plans for the employment of
the able-bodied poor.</p>

<p>Even if efforts for this purpose had been much
needed after the outbreak of the Civil War it is
probable that they would have been less enforced
than other parts of the system of poor relief. We see from
the justices' reports that schemes of this kind were not usually
undertaken, except under pressure from the justices. The
privation of the helpless old and young appealed far more to
the sympathy of overseers and ratepayers than the needs of the
able-bodied poor. Besides it was far easier to grant pensions
than to superintend work and supply materials.</p>

<p>But a far stronger reason existed for the discontinuance of
the parochial stocks for employing the poor. The necessities
of the war made enormous demands upon the able-bodied males
of the population. The Parliamentary army was recruited
from the men above the age of sixteen and below the age of
sixty. An attempt has been made to make a rough estimate of
the proportion of Hertfordshire men drawn away by the war.
If in 1642 the population of Hertfordshire was about one-sixth
of that of the present time it would amount to about 36,000
men, women and children, and this would mean about 9,000
men of an age fit for active service. But in the summer of
1644 apparently between four and five thousand Hertfordshire
men were serving in the Parliamentary army and others with
the Royalists, so that a large portion of the work of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>country would necessarily have to be done by women, old
men and boys<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>.</p>

<p>This calculation is very rough, but it probably approximates
to the truth. We hear from the complaints of the time that
much inconvenience was felt. In 1644 the Grand Jury of
Hertford Quarter Sessions beg that "in regard their harvest
is at hand and their labourers few to gather it, some part of
their soldiers ... may be for a while recalled to assist herein."
The Committee of the Eastern counties about the same time
write that they have promised that some of the Hertfordshire
men shall return "considering the necessity of their attendance
upon their harvest<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>."</p>

<p>The drain on the supply of labourers might not have been
so great in all districts and at all times, but it must have been
considerable; the problem to be solved would therefore be to
find workmen and not to find work. The difficulty of getting
men is indicated by the fact that the Parliamentary army
offered two and sixpence a day to a waggoner instead of the
shilling or one and threepence usual before the war<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>. All who
were not altogether incapable could get employment, and
there would therefore be no need for the parochial stocks of
materials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. State of
poor relief
after the Restoration.</div>

<p>We should therefore expect that the lax administration
during the war would affect the schemes for the
employment of the poor more than any other part
of the organisation, and the evidence of many
treatises published between the Restoration and the Revolution
show us that this was the case. Order had been somewhat
restored, and the impotent poor were then relieved, but the
practice of finding work had so much fallen into disuse that its
former existence was almost forgotten. Thus in a pamphlet
published in 1673, called "The grand Concern of England
explained<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>," the writer states that the money paid for the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>at that time amounted to £840,000 a year, and "is employed
only to maintain idle persons." He proposed that instead of
giving the poor weekly allowance, both old and young should
be set to work at spinning, or some similar occupation. Another
treatise, published in 1683, has been attributed to Sir Matthew
Hale<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>, and likewise shows that little was then done for the
able-bodied poor. The author says, "Indeed there are rates
made for the impotent poor.... But it is rare to see any provision
of a stock in any Parish for the relief of the poor." The word
"stock" is here used in the sense of capital for the employment
of the poor, and this writer also states that the law provides that
sums of this kind should be so raised. He gives many reasons
for the neglect in the matter. One of these is that there was
no authority in the Justices of Peace or other superintendent
officials to compel the raising of a stock where the churchwardens
and overseers neglected it. Both practice and opinion as
to the requirements of the law had considerably altered since in
1629 the Privy Council told the justices that it was the opinion
of all the judges that they both had the power and the right to
levy stocks to set the poor on work, and since in 1631 the justices
from all parts sent in the reports on the Book of Orders<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>.</p>

<p>The author of a pamphlet of 1685<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> also points out that by
the law of Elizabeth the parish was bound to provide "work for
those that will labour, punishment for those that will not, and
bread for those that cannot; and if the first two parts of that
law were duly observed the Poor would not only be reduced to
a small number comparatively to what they now are, but there
would be no such poor as idle and wandering rogues and vagabonds."
The writer further complains that work was not provided
for those who will labour, but only bread both for those
who can and those who cannot labour. These pamphlets thus
afford abundant proof that the plan of raising a stock had fallen
into disuse in the reign of Charles II., and few efforts were
made to employ the poor until new workhouses were founded in
different towns, each by separate Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">5. Reasons
for failure under
the Commonwealth
to
restore the old
state of things.</div>

<p>This disorganisation, we have seen, was owing to the Civil
War. It is easy to see that when the war was
ended, it would be difficult to restore the old state
of things because the old conditions were altered.
The Privy Council after the Restoration had a much
less paternal method of governing, and moreover the nation had
outgrown the old methods of organisation: the Council of
State of the Commonwealth did however try to restore some of
the old remedies.</p>

<p>But under the Commonwealth the justices could no longer
have been as efficient instruments for carrying out the poor law
as before. Many of those who had formerly had most local
influence were in banishment or disgrace; others had lost
heavily by the sacrifices made for the war. Probably those who
remained were chiefly interested in the more exciting political
and religious questions of the time. But without an energetic
Council and vigorous and powerful justices acting in sympathy
with them, the administration of the poor law had been ineffectual
in the reign of Elizabeth and in that of James I. We
should therefore expect the same result under the Commonwealth
and Charles II., except for the difference made by the ten
years in which the relief of the poor had been efficient. The
whole of the improvement was not lost, but enough of it to
show how much the execution of the law had depended on the
Book of Orders, and enough to make the poor relief granted in
the years immediately preceding the war different from that of
any future time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. History
of Legislation
on poor relief
in Scotland.</div>

<p>We will now briefly glance at the history of poor relief in
Scotland. Prof. Ashley has shown us that poor
laws were not at first peculiarly English institutions.
In every country of Western Europe
like difficulties seem to have occurred at about the same time.
Every one of these countries was developing in new industrial
and commercial directions, and all were becoming more peaceably
and quietly governed. France, Germany, Holland and
Scotland were alike troubled with unemployed vagrants and
unrelieved poor. The monastic houses and hospitals under the
old system certainly failed to cure the evil, perhaps they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
increased it. Municipal regulations and state laws dealing
with beggars and almsgiving therefore appear alike in France,
Germany, Scotland, and England, and at about the same time<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the history of poor relief in Scotland
and in France is so like that of England as to suggest
similar conditions or possibly conscious imitation. In all three
countries it is a history of successive enactments in which the
legal right of the poor to relief is created, and in which more
and more pressure is employed to obtain the necessary funds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6 <i>a</i>. History
of legislation
in Scotland
before 1597.</div>

<p>In Scotland as in England before 1535 there are a series of
vagabond acts<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>, and in 1535 a statute was passed
bearing a strong resemblance to those passed in
England under Henry VIII. The punishments of
whipping awarded to vagrants under the older Acts were continued,
and no beggar was to be allowed to beg in any parish
except that of his birth. New regulations were introduced
with regard to funds as in the contemporary English statute;
the head men of each parish were to "make takings" and to
distribute to the beggars belonging to the parish and to them
only<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>. Thus, as in the England of 1536, parochial responsibility
was recognised, and the funds were to be raised within the
parish, but without compulsion.</p>

<p>The next important change in Scotch legislation was made
in 1574, and the provisions then made were continued and
amplified in 1579. In this later statute the resemblance to the
English Act of 1572 seems more than accidental. Both the
Scotch and the English statutes begin with decreeing sharp
punishments for vagrants, although those of the Scotch law are
the more severe. But the later clauses of both statutes deal
with relief, and in the Scottish enactment these are introduced
almost in the words of the English regulations, "And since
charity would, that the poor, aged and impotent persons should
be as necessarilie provided for, as the vagabonds and strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>beggars repressed, and that the aged and impotent poor people
should have lodging and abyding places throughout the realm
to settle themselves into," it is ordained that the provost and
bailies in the towns and the justice in every landward parish
shall inquire into the names and condition of the poor and
impotent people born in the parish, or who have lived there
seven years, and shall make a register book containing their
names and surnames. And in order that every parish may
know its own poor, all poor people are ordered to return to the
parish where they belonged within eleven days. The provost
and bailies and justices are then to provide for the sustenance
and lodging of those that must live by alms; in order to meet
the cost they are "to tax and stent the whole inhabitants
within the parish according to the estimation of their substance,
without exception of persons, to such weekly charge and contribution
as shall be thought expedient and sufficient to sustain
the said poor people." Overseers and collectors were to be
chosen in every town and parish, and any person who refused
to contribute or discouraged others from so doing was, if convicted,
to remain in prison until he obeyed the order of the
parish. Badged beggars were allowed in some parishes,
prisoners were to be relieved and children were to be apprenticed<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>.</p>

<p>Compulsory taxation, parochial responsibility, the authority
of justices or municipal rulers, the appointment of overseers and
the provision made for the impotent poor and children are like
those of the English Act. But there is no regulation concerning
the employment of the able-bodied poor and the clauses concerning
apprentices are far more severe than those in the
contemporary English statute<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>.</p>

<p>There are other vagabond Acts in 1592 and 1593, and the
Act of 1592 ordains that the Act of 1579 shall be as well
executed in all parts of the realm as it has been in Edinburgh<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>This seems to show that in Scotland as in England the statutes
of this time were badly executed, but were not altogether a
dead letter<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6 <i>b</i>. History
of legislation
in Scotland
from 1597 to
1680.</div>

<p>But in 1597 the next important change occurs. It begins
by a clause which approximates the poor relief
system still more to that in force in England.
"Strong beggars and their bairns" are to "be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>employed in common work during their life times." But it
concludes with a clause that separates the likeness hitherto
existing between the regulations of the two countries. The
execution of the law in landward parishes is placed in the
hands of the kirk session<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.</p>

<p>Henceforward the history of poor relief in Scotland is
different from that of England. In England the law of 1597, as
re-enacted in 1601, remained the chief enactment for dealing
with the poor throughout the century, but in Scotland, on the
contrary, many alterations in the law were made; sometimes
the kirk session was declared responsible for relieving the poor,
at other times the justices, sometimes the heritors of the parish,
were to assist the sessions, at other times the presbytery;
sometimes the impotent were to be better relieved, at other
times the able-bodied were to be employed in Houses of Correction<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>:
statute succeeded statute in the seventeenth century as
in the sixteenth, and for the most part with as little result.</p>

<p>Still, in spite of these many alterations, the Scotch poor law
always resembled that of England in insisting on the duty of
each parish to support three classes of people, (1) the aged poor,
(2) the lame and blind, &amp;c., and (3) orphans and destitute
children. But the able-bodied poor of Scotland, unlike those of
England, were not entitled to either work or relief. No legal
provision was made for them except in Houses of Correction<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">7. Failure of
administration
in Scotland.</div>

<p>But during the seventeenth century even the relief given to
the old and to the young in Scotland was not
thoroughly administered. Not only do the frequent
enactments of the legislature show that the governing
class were not satisfied with the result of the existing laws on
the subject, but the fact that the Scotch poor laws were on the
whole ineffectual is also indicated by the response made by the
justices to the Scotch Privy Council, by the hardships which
the poor suffered in the time of dearth at the close of the
century, and by the continued existence of beggars, licensed or
unlicensed, not only in the seventeenth century but until the
beginning of the present reign.</p>

show that
they were unable

to enforce

and left it to
the kirk sessions.</div>

<p>In Scotland as in England the Privy Council endeavoured
to induce the justices to secure a better administration
of the poor laws. But the Scotch justices
possessed less legal authority than their English
colleagues, while they also were less inclined either
to obey the Council or to impose taxation. Consequently
the efforts of the Scotch Privy Council
failed while those of the English Privy Council
succeeded. The effect of the Council's interference
in Scotland can be seen in the events of the year 1623.</p>

<p>This was a time of great hardship. "Mony famileis and
tennentis and labouraris of the ground who formarlie wer
honnest houshalderis ... ar now turned beggaris thame selffis and

distress the Council issued an order that the destitute poor of
each parish should be adequately supported, and that constables
should be provided to apprehend and punish vagrants. The
expense of both proceedings was to be met by a tax levied
upon all the inhabitants of the district.</p>

<p>The replies of the Scotch justices to this order bring out the
difference which existed between England and Scotland in law,
opinions and practice and the consequent difficulty in enforcing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>in Scotland a thorough organisation of poor relief. Thus the
justices of Haddington and Lothian write that in regard to the
tax which was ordered by the Council for apprehending and
keeping of idle beggars they "doutt if ane simple proclamatioun
be ane sufficient warrand unto us to sett doun stent upoun
every man"; with regard to the relief of the poor they thought
the general contribution beneficial, but "becaus every contributioun
is odious and smellis of ane taxatioun they could not
undertak how to proceid thairin, being ane matter beyond thair
capacitie<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>." The justices of Edinburgh reply that "thair is no
jaillis nor warding plaices within the parochins nor touns of this
sherefdome that is able to conteine a tent pairt of the pure
beging in the same," order was therefore given in Edinburgh
that every landed gentleman should sustain his own poor, and
that the ministers should exhort their parishioners to refrain
from giving alms to the able-bodied beggars<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>. Other justices
arrange meetings to discuss the best means of relieving the
destitution which existed; they nearly all report that it is best
for the kirk sessions to "stent" their own parishioners, and for
each landlord to support the poor on his estate<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>.</p>

<p>Again in 1631 and 1632 there are signs of greater care for
the poor in Scotland, and this may be due to the action of the
Council, but in Scotland it seems clear that the justices left the
administration almost entirely in the hands of the kirk sessions,
and that the kirk sessions were not induced to enforce an
adequate system of poor relief for a long term of years. Consequently
Scottish poor relief remained in the seventeenth century
in much the same condition as it had been in both England and
Scotland in the preceding period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>b</i>. Inadequate
relief
given by the
kirk sessions
of Banff.</div>

<p>In Scotland, as in both countries before 1597, assistance
was given to the poor by the parochial officials,
and the money was raised by collections at the
church doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>How small these contributions were may be seen from
the records of the town and parish of Banff. In 1624 the
condition of the poor at Banff was discussed during the visitation
of the presbytery, and the "haill eldership promised
to have ane faithfull cair for provisioune of thair awne
poore and to purge ther bounds of vagabond beggares." No
improved method of relief was reported at the next visitation,
but the "minister and eldares" again promise to look after
the poor<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. In 1631, however, some arrangement was actually
made. No one was to give alms to strange beggars, and the
town poor were to be relieved in their homes. But, in order to
secure this result, provision was made only for twenty poor,
although the population of the town probably numbered nearly
two thousand<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>. It seems likely that this was about the amount
of assistance granted in Banff throughout the century, for in
1673 it is noted that twenty-seven poor received assistance from
the kirk sessions, and in 1691 only twenty-five<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>. This relief
was so insufficient that beggars abounded; in 1633 £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
was paid "To Willie Wat, scurger for outhalding the poore<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>";
in 1642 vagrant beggars were to be put in the "theiffis hoill"
until the magistrates had time to see them well scourged, while
in 1698 and again in 1742 the system of badged beggars was
adopted<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>, which is itself an admission of the insufficiency of the
relief afforded by the parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">7 <i>c</i>. The relief
of the poor
in Aberdeen.</div>

<p>Occasionally also, as in Elizabethan England, the burgesses
of particular towns saw that the poor could not
live on the relief granted by the church officials,
and made great efforts to raise additional funds so
that they might be able to free their town from beggars. But,
as the convention of Scotch boroughs stated in 1579, it was
difficult to grant relief in one town only, because there were so
many beggars from other parts. In Scotland, as in England
under Elizabeth, the town systems of poor relief ceased to be
successful after a few years. The efforts in this direction made
in Aberdeen are probably fairly typical of those attempted by
more philanthropic burgesses. Even in 1595 the inhabitants
of Aberdeen had distributed the destitute "babis" and had
levied voluntary contributions for the other poor<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. Early in the
seventeenth century, however, beggars existed who were licensed
by the town<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>, and in 1619 the "haill towne" was again convened,
and it was agreed that all the beggars should be
sustained in their homes and prevented from begging. It was
estimated that the cost would amount to 2,600 marks, and
£1,000 of this was to be raised "by way of taxatioun," while
eleven hundred marks was to be obtained from the contributions
at communion or collections at the church doors<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>. Two years
later, in April 1621, we are told that "the wark hes hed a gude
and happie succes so that the haill poor peopill within this
burght that were then beggaris have beine now almost these
thrie yeiris past interteained and keiped from begging." It was
therefore then agreed that the same methods should "stand and
continew" always, and that the town should continue to contribute
its thousand pounds a year, that the poor might be
relieved at home<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>. Why the plan failed does not appear, but it
did fail, since in 1650 tickets were given to the town beggars of
Aberdeen to distinguish them from those of other districts<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>In Aberdeen, therefore, we can see that the money raised by
the kirk sessions was only about half the amount which the
town rulers considered necessary for the adequate support of the
poor, and that when the town was kept free from beggars resort
had to be made to a compulsory tax.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>d</i>. Infrequency
of assessment
in
Scotland before
1818.</div>

<p>But compulsory taxes were very unpopular both in Scotland
and England, but while in England they were
forced on the people by the justices of the peace,
acting under instructions from the Privy Council,
in Scotland they never were generally adopted
until the present century. In the report of 1818 the temporary
arrangements of Aberdeen and other towns<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> were forgotten, and
it was then said that before 1700 only three parishes had
resorted to compulsion<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>. This means that only three parishes
continued to use assessments for a long period, and therefore
the poor relief granted in Scotland was almost always the
voluntary assistance given by the kirk sessions.</p>

<div class="sidenoteright">7 <i>e</i>. Insufficiency
of relief
granted during
the years 1692-1699.</div>

<p>How insufficient this assistance was is indicated by the
proclamations issued during the years of scarcity
at the close of the century. The period from 1692
to 1699 has been called the "seven ill years." The
poor suffered great distress, and a series of proclamations
was issued by the Privy Council with the object of
remedying matters.</p>

<p>In 1692 the first proclamation was published; this stated
that the Act for Houses of Correction had been neglected, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>ordered the heritors and inhabitants of each parish to meet and
put in execution the other good laws made for the poor<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. In
the same year a second proclamation was issued which stated
that the previous order had had little effect because it was
uncertain where the beggars were born and because suitable
provision was not made for them in their parishes<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. The next
year therefore another proclamation was promulgated, and, it is
said, "due obedience" was not yet given to the laws, "so that
the poor are not duly provided for in many places nor the
vagabonds restrained." In 1698 the fourth and last proclamation
was published, and again it is stated that the poor laws
have not taken effect, partly because there were no houses
provided for the poor and partly because the people responsible
for the execution of the laws had been negligent of their duty<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>.</p>

<p>The statements of these proclamations show that little poor
relief was then administered in Scotland, but a stronger proof
that this was so is furnished by the existence of the misery
endured by the poor during these years: this was so great that
it is said whole parishes in some districts were nearly depopulated<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>f</i>. Insufficiency
of relief
indicated by
prevalence of
beggary.</div>

<p>But the fact which throws the strongest light upon the
administration of poor relief in Scotland is the
continued existence of beggary. This was the real
method by which most of the poor were relieved.
Even the Town Council of Aberdeen tolerated
licensed beggars, and in 1664 a resolution was passed by the
synod, which shows that the licensing of beggars was then
a general practice in the diocese; it is ordained that a minister
should license "those creaving for support" only within his own
parish<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1699 the beggars of Stirling also were licensed<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>the existence of licensed beggars was not the worst of the evil.
This method of dealing with the matter, it is true, is very strong
evidence that insufficient poor relief was given because it is
furnished by the administrators themselves; the beggar must
be destitute, or they ought not to have given him a license, and
he could hardly have been among those who were too proud to
receive relief. But the districts where unlicensed beggary prevailed
were in a far worse condition. How great the evil was
may be seen from the evidence of Fletcher of Saltoun, who
wrote in 1698. His complaints and even his language closely
resemble that of Harman when he describes the English beggars
under Henry VIII., and that of Hext, concerning those who
lived under Elizabeth; they are in strong contrast to the self-satisfied
reports of the English justices of the reign of Charles I.
"There are," he says, "at this day in Scotland (besides a great
number of families very meanly provided for by the church
boxes, with others, who, living upon bad food, fall into various
diseases) 200,000 people begging from door to door. These are
not only no ways advantageous, but a very grievous burden to
so poor a country, and though the number of them be perhaps
double to what it was formerly, by reason of the present great
distress, yet in all times there have been about 100,000 of these
vagabonds who have lived without any regard or submission
either to the laws of the land or even of those of God and
nature.... No magistrate could ever discover or be informed
which way any of these wretches died, or that ever they were
baptized. Many murders have been discovered among them;
and they are not only a most unspeakable oppression to poor
tenants (who, if they give not bread or some sort of provision
to perhaps forty such villains in one day, are sure to be insulted
by them), but they rob many poor people, who live in houses
distant from any neighbourhood. In years of plenty many
thousands of them meet together in the mountains, where they
feast and riot for many days; and at country weddings, markets,
burials and other like public occasions, they are to be seen, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>men and women, perpetually drunk, cursing, blaspheming and
fighting together<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>."</p>

<p>This terrible state of things indicates clearly that no efficient
system of poor relief was then in force in Scotland, and shows
the evil resulting from trusting the relief of the poor to charity,
when charity was altogether insufficient. It is, however, well
known that in more charitable days the Scotch system of poor
relief found many supporters who urged that the poor obtained
sufficient help, and that the organisation which relied on charity
called forth a much more noble spirit in both rich and poor than
that which depended upon compulsion. This opinion prevailed
especially in 1818, although even then beggary was nearly
universal<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> in Scotland, but it must be remembered that in 1818
Scottish poor relief gained by comparison with the English
because England was then suffering from the increase in
pauperism produced by the lax rules of administration which
had been introduced into her system of poor relief during the
preceding twenty-five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7 <i>g</i>. Reasons
for the failure
of the administration
in
Scotland.</div>

<p>But in the seventeenth century the danger was rather that
there should be too little relief than too much.
The citizens of Glasgow, like those of Aberdeen,
introduced compulsory assessments, and said the
"commendable cair" for the poor now shown was
"to the glorie of God and good report of this citie"; but, in
spite of this good result, altered their methods, apparently
because of the unpopularity of the poor rate<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>. It is easy to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>why this happened. Town governors and kirk officials were
much more affected by unpopularity with the ratepayers than
justices of the peace, and were much less influenced by the
central government. Consequently it seems that because in
Scotland the system of poor relief was not in the hands of the
justices of the peace, there was no period in the history of
Scotch poor relief corresponding to the years in which the Book
of Orders was enforced in England under Charles I. The result
was that in Scotland the poor laws though made were not
thoroughly administered until the present reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. The history
of poor
relief in
France.</div>

<p>The history of poor relief in France is very similar to
that in Scotland, except that in the earlier
stages French legislation is in advance of that
of England.</p>

<p>After the middle of the fourteenth century there were
vagrant laws in France and Paris as in Scotland and England.
The first general measure for the relief of the poor also is
almost exactly contemporaneous in all three countries. In
1536, Francis I. issued two edicts. The first ordains "that
the impotent poor who have room and lodging and dwelling
houses shall be nourished and entertained by their parishes, and
for this purpose a register shall be made by the curés, vicars
or churchwardens, each for his own parish," in order that these
officers may distribute alms to the poor who are disabled.
In each parish boxes were to be placed in which offerings were
to be collected, and every Sunday, in Paris as in England, the
preachers in their sermons were to exhort their hearers to contribute.
Abbeys, priories, chapters and colleges were to give
their alms to this box<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.</p>

<p>By a second edict of King Francis, issued in this year, the
able-bodied poor were compelled to labour in return for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>alms, and it was ordered that the ordinances made in Paris
concerning the poor should be binding also in the towns of
Brittany<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>. These edicts of King Francis contain almost exactly
similar provisions to those of the statutes of Henry VIII., even
in matters of detail.</p>

<p>Several other edicts between this and 1551 concern the
poor, chiefly the Parisian poor. Public works were established
to employ them, and efforts were made to succour the impotent
poor in hospitals. In 1544 a governing body for the poor was
established by Letters Patent, and the right of levying a tax or
poor rate was given to this new authority<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. But the new taxation
met with much opposition, and in 1551 an ordinance was
issued which bears a very close resemblance to the English
statute of 1563. All the inhabitants of Paris and the suburbs
were to state how much they were willing to contribute to the
support of the poor. Their answers were to be laid before the
Parliament, which was then to assess everyone according to his
wealth. The object of the edict was to make the taxation
voluntary if possible without surrendering the right of imposing
compulsory payment. Even at the Revolution this contribution
had not altogether disappeared, although it was too small an
amount to have much<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> practical effect.</p>

<p>In 1566 it was again ordered that throughout France every
town and every village was to care for its own poor<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>. In
particular towns a good deal was done: not only were public
workshops opened in Paris<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>, but in 1612 new hospitals were
established, and in Lyons and in certain other towns the same
kind of relief was given.</p>

<p>But, as in England in the sixteenth century, relief was only
administered in particular districts and for a short time. In
France as in Scotland the history of the seventeenth century
was like that of the sixteenth. Edict succeeded edict; they
had some result but not much; no general system was ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>established, nor were the poor ever effectually relieved. Perhaps
it was impossible that laws of this kind should be executed
in France because the French did not possess any county officials
like the English justices of the peace. The Council might be
willing to enforce the law, but the necessary machinery was
wanting, and consequently in France as in Scotland poor laws
were only made; they were not thoroughly administered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9. Comparison
between
history of poor
relief in England
and that
in France and
Scotland.</div>

<p>The history of poor relief in France and Scotland thus seems
to bring into greater prominence the fact that the
English organisation is not exactly the inevitable
result of the statute of 1601. Like causes led to
like regulations in all three countries, but the
regulations did not lead to the same result. The
organisation of poor relief in France and Scotland continued in
the English sixteenth century stage down to the present
century. In the light of their history we can understand the
preamble to the commission of 1631. The justices acted in
many parts as if the poor laws were obsolete, and they were
always tending to become obsolete in France and Scotland. In
England that stage was passed during the ten years of the
enforcement of the Book of Orders. Privy Council and justices
were alike effective at the same time; the Privy Council took
action, and the justices were urged to do their duty. Few
officials, perhaps none, could have done the work so well. If
the justices of later days granted too much relief it was because
of the justices of Charles I. that relief was ever efficiently
administered at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Summary
of history of
English
system of
poor relief
before the
Civil War.</div>

<p>We have now traced the history of the making and early
administration of the English Poor Law. We have
seen that the English system of poor relief like
the English House of Commons was once only one
of many like institutions common to the whole of
Western Europe. Although in our century other
nations have again regulated the help given to the poor by
public authorities, in neither France, Scotland nor Germany
has the public organisation for the relief of the destitute a
continuous history. The system survived in England alone
among the greater nations of Europe. It began as part of the
labour statutes, but the regulations of Richard II. had probably
little practical effect. The administration of relief of the poor
by secular authorities seems to have been first really organised
under Henry VIII. by London, Ipswich, and other towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Even after this public poor relief was not thoroughly established
for more than another century.</p>

<p>These municipal orders were followed by statutes adopting
similar regulations for the whole country. But the statutes were
very irregularly enforced; they were constantly neglected, and new
legislation was passed with little better result. Still the great
distress of the years of scarcity of 1594 to 1597 excited public
attention; men like Bacon and Raleigh joined in the discussions
of Parliament and in 1597 the statutory provisions were made
which remained for the most part unchanged until 1834. But
the law was only well executed for a few years: good administration
rather than good legislation was necessary, and it is in
regard to the provision for administration rather than in regard
to municipal regulations or statutory enactments that the
history of England differs from that of France and Scotland.</p>

<p>The difference was mainly caused by the coexistence in
England of a Privy Council active in matters concerning the
poor and of a powerful body of county and municipal officers
who were willing to obey the Privy Council.</p>

<p>Even in the reign of Elizabeth the Privy Council sometimes
interfered in enforcing measures of relief, but only as a
temporary expedient for relieving the distress caused by years
of scarcity. But from 1629 to 1640 they acted continuously
in this direction and by means of the Book of Orders succeeded,
as far as children and the impotent poor were concerned, in
securing the due execution of the law.</p>

<p>The Council also succeeded in inducing the justices to
provide work for the able-bodied poor in many of the districts
in the eastern counties, and in some places in almost every
county.</p>

<p>This provision of work was provided either in Houses of
Correction or in the parishes. In the former case it was
punitive, in the latter it was given mainly with the object of
enabling the unemployed to earn their living; in both cases it
was often accompanied by training in a trade. It does not
seem to have been designed at all as a test for the applicant
for relief. The poor of the parishes were probably well known;
the strange poor were all supposed to be sent indiscriminately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to the House of Correction; moreover no other form of relief
was granted to the able-bodied poor except when the parishes
failed to find sufficient work.</p>

<p>The organisation was needed because it was an age of
economic transition; the agricultural revolution prevented men
from finding work in their old employments, while under the
new industrial organisation earnings were more unstable even
when they were higher than they were before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. The
political side
of this
paternal
government.</div>

<div class="sidenoteright">2 <i>a</i>. Possible
attempt to
secure the
adhesion of
poorer classes
to government.</div>

<p>It may be that there is a political side to the policy of
Charles's Council in this matter. Dr Gardiner
suggests that the adoption of this policy of
paternal government may be attributed to the
influence of Wentworth. "It can hardly be by
accident that his accession to the Privy Council
was followed by a series of measures aiming at the
benefit of the people in general, and at the protection
of the helpless against the pressure caused by the self
interest of particular classes<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>."</p>

<p>There were also other members of the Council who were
likely to be interested in enforcing orders for the benefit of
the poorer classes. Sir Julius Caesar, the Master of the
Rolls, was at that time in office. He certainly was very
charitable if not very wise in his charity. He is described by
Fuller as "a person of prodigious bounty to all of worth or
want so that he might seem to be Almoner-General of the
Nation. The story is well known of a Gentleman who once
borrowing his Coach (which was as well known to poor people
as any Hospital in England) was so rendevouzed about with
Beggers in London that it cost him all the money in his purse
to satisfie their importunity; so that he might have hired
twenty coaches on the same terms<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>." It is also probable that
Laud may have had something to do with the strict enforcement
of the apprentice part of the law in 1633-4, for we have
seen he was much interested in apprenticeship, and founded
many charities for the purpose himself.</p>

<p>Dr Gardiner also thinks that this policy "may serve as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>indication that there were some at least in the Council who in
their quarrel with the aristocracy were anxious to fall back
upon an alliance with the people<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>." It is very possibly not
entirely accidental that the name of John Caesar is attached
to a report from Edwinstree in 1639 in which the inhabitants
are "well disposed in relegion, obedient to gou(ern)m<sup>t</sup> and
forward in pious and charitable accons<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>," while the district of
John Hampden sent up at least one protest as to the measures
of scarcity<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2 <i>b</i>. The use
of proclamations
and
orders in
Council for a
popular purpose.</div>

<p>There is however possibly another political side to these
orders. The measures which were designed to
protect the poor from the undue rapacity of
traders or from the carelessness of parochial officials
were nearly all enforced by proclamations and
orders in Council. Generally these orders were
in accordance with the letter of the law and almost always
with the spirit which had dictated the legislation; but still
the fact that proclamations and orders in Council were used
to enforce this popular side of government may have been
designed to increase the popularity of government by this
means; it certainly tended to habituate the justices to their
use and to make the majority of the nation cease to regard
them as instruments of tyranny.</p>

<p>This danger was not unforeseen at the time. A knowledge
of it probably influenced the reply of the Scotch justices
when they doubted if "ane simple proclamatioun be ane sufficient
warrand" for levying a tax<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>, but there is also a remarkable
protest by John Hawarde in 1597 when he is recording the
enforcement of the measures undertaken to help the poor at
that time. He says that engrossers, and forestallers of corn
in London were proceeded against "by the Queen's prerogative
only and by proclamation, councils, orders and letters,
and thus their decrees, councils, proclamations, and orders
shall be a firm and forcible law and of the like force as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>Common law or an Act of Parliament." The Puritan lawyer
jealously notes that the builders of illegal cottages and negligent
justices also were to be punished "on the proclamation
and not on the statute<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>." "And this is the intent," he says,
"of the Privy Councillors in our day and time to attribute to
their councils and orders the vigour, force and power of a firm
law and of higher virtue and force, jurisdiction and preheminence'
than any positive law, whether it be the common
law or statute law. And thus in a short time the Privy
Councillors of this realm would be the most honourable, noble
and commanding lords in all the world and [have] the majesty
of prince and ruler of the greatest reverence in all the world<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>."</p>

<p>It is quite possible that this side of government was enforced
by the orders in Council simply as a matter of convenience; it
might have been difficult to pass new legislation contrary to
the interests of the middle classes through a body in which
the representation of those classes was so great as it was in
the Tudor and Stuart House of Commons.</p>

<p>But if the danger of allowing the royal prerogative to be
used apart from statute law was seen and protested against
under the popular Queen Elizabeth, it would certainly also
excite opposition in the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>The substance of the orders however does not appear to
have excited opposition. Men of both sides sent in their
reports to the Privy Council, and more energetic measures to
execute the poor law were taken in the Puritan counties of the
east than in any other part of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Effect of
the enforcement
of the
Book of Orders
in the
reign of
Charles I.</div>

<p>The effects of the enforcement of the Elizabethan poor law
and of the Book of Orders were considerable both
in the reign of Charles I. and ever since that time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>Harman's book, the many insurrections and riots
of the sixteenth century, the letter of Justice Hext
and the statements in many proclamations show
us how great was the disorder in England during the reigns of
the Tudors and James I. The Somersetshire justice almost
unconsciously reveals the main part of the reason. Many
people, he tells us, were emboldened to say, "They must not
starve, They will not starve," and so the honest countryman
suffered from the depredations of rogues and could hardly
endure the burdens laid upon him<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>. "Maximus magister
venter" quotes another writer of the period; repression did
little good until it was accompanied by relief. Moreover it was
impossible to enforce the repressive regulations against vagrants
until relief was administered because the "foolish pity" of the
inhabitants and of the justices prevented punishments from
being inflicted. Throughout the sixteenth century and, after a
short interval after 1597, again in the reign of James I. there
are complaints of the increase of vagrants and of the disorder
in the country<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.</p>

<p>The effect of the Book of Orders cannot be lightly estimated
if we contrast the statements of Justice Hext and his contemporaries
with those of the justices under Charles I. Complaints
of great disorder then cease in all parts of the country except
London. In many places vagabonds are said to no longer
trouble the neighbourhood. In High Peak the justices state
"nowe wee haue fewe or noe wanderers<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>"; at Wallington in
Surrey few vagabonds are taken because now only a small
number come to the hundred<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>; while at Andover there is "scarce
a vagrant found about vs nor are any pickeryes com(m)itted<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>."
In a few places, as at Bramber<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>, the improvement is stated to
be owing to the activity of Provost Marshals but in many
other places it is directly connected with the Book of Orders.
Thus in parts of Westmoreland we hear that there was great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>improvement in consequence of the enforcement of the poor law
in 1638; "idle persons haue beene banished out of the countrey"
and the poor of the neighbourhood were "more willing to take
paynes<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>." In two divisions of Shropshire it was "rare to see a
wandring person<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>," and at Appletree in Derby the overseers
relieve the poor and set to work "such as are poore and yett well
able to worke w<sup>ch</sup> wee fynde doeth very much good in the
cuntrye<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>." But the most decided symptoms of improvement
are indicated by a report from a district of Leicestershire which
reveals a state of things in strong contrast to that of Somerset
in 1596. The justices record a very careful attention to the
Book of Orders, especially the parts relating to setting the poor
to work, teaching knitting to the young and placing out apprentices
"that yong people and children may receive imployment
and fittinge educacon and soe avoide idlenes and lewdenes of
life." These efforts they tell us "in all partes of the cou(n)tie
hath already wrought soe good effect; as that since the last
Assizes to the day of the date hereof there is come into the
comon gaole in the cou(n)ty of Leic. but two prisoners for two
small felonyes, committed by two seu(er)all yonge people, beinge
servants settled at the tyme of the offences committed<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>."</p>

<p>The disappearance of vagrants, the decrease of felonies and
increase of order are reported as the direct consequence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>administration of the Book of Orders. Other causes may have
contributed to this result, but the reports of the justices from
so many places in different parts of the country are conclusive
evidence that efficient relief of the poor hastened the time
when the peaceable citizen and peasant could work and live in
security and quietness.</p>

<p>This great belief in the good results of the work and of the
relief afforded is very characteristic of the administrators of the
time. If the system of the seventeenth century had many
disadvantages when concerned with the more capable members
of the community, its dealings with the poor compare very
favourably with the methods possible in a freer community.
The modern philanthropist may talk about being an individualist
but he cannot be one. He cannot punish the idler and the
drunkard as such directly and so it is rarely possible for him to
aid the innocent members of a family without encouraging the
guilty. Consequently he cannot deal with individuals on their
merits, he can only deal with families. But in the seventeenth
century the drunkard was either fined or placed in the stocks,
and the idler was sent to the House of Correction. You might
then help the rest of his family to find employment or have the
young children taught in knitting schools and apprenticed
without dangerously weakening the incentives to industry
and sobriety. The direct punishment had a good effect in
dealing with people for whom the community made itself
responsible. It sacrificed only the individuality of the offender
and not that of all his family. Consequently there was little
danger in the increase of organised relief and it seems to have
produced good results. The comments when we hear them are
all in a satisfied tone. The Norwich magistrates were delighted
with their organisation after seven years' trial and this in the
reign of Elizabeth when the complaints were great in most
parts of the country where little relief was given.</p>

<p>The stocks for the poor might be expected to operate unfavourably
on the wages of unskilled labour; but there is no
trace of their having done so. Wages rose during the Commonwealth
it is true, but they rose also during the reigns of the
earlier Stuarts and continued to rise until near the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
century. This rise in wages seems to have been increased rather
than checked by the enforcement of the Book of Orders, probably
because the casual labourer had a far more depressing
effect on the labour market when he wandered everywhere than
when he was regularly employed by the stock of his parish.
Moreover if the system affected wages at all, it would affect the
unskilled labourer rather than the skilled. But after the Civil
War the unskilled labourer gains relatively less: it is the more
skilled forms of labour that are better paid<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>. It thus seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>fairly certain that the stocks for setting the poor to work did
not unfavourably influence the wages of the lower class of
labourers.</p>

<p>The setting of the poor to work in this period cannot be
judged as if it were part of the system of free competition of
modern England. There was little notion of free competition;
state and town interfered in wages and in the management of
industry; everyone was subject to restrictions in the supposed
interests of the nation, and the stocks for the poor were almost
a necessary complement of this national organisation of industry.
The idea of the time was to maintain a stable condition of
affairs; the attempt to find employment for the poor in their
slack times corresponded to the measures taken to lower prices
in the years of bad harvests and to secure the interests of
the employers when labourers were scarce and wages rising.
Whatever effect these attempts may have had on industry as a
whole they certainly lessened the immediate sufferings of the
unemployed during this time of transition and they must be
taken into account in any attempt to estimate the condition
of the poor at the period.</p>

<p>So far as the temporary difficulties of the seventeenth
century were concerned therefore, the system established by
the Book of Orders lessened the misery of the poor and
contributed to the establishment of order.</p>

<p>But the whole of the poor law did not disappear during
the Civil War. It is true that the existing schemes for the
employment of the poor were discontinued but the relief of
the impotent and the care of children have continued down to
our own time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. Results
of poor relief
in later times.</div>

<p>We have been so accustomed to hear of the evils of the
law of settlement and the abuses of the relief
granted in aid of wages, that we perhaps fail to
consider the better effects of the existence of a
system of poor relief.</p>

<div class="sidenoteright">4 <i>a</i>. The increased
union
of rich and
poor.</div>

<p>In the first place the method of administration has helped
to unite the different classes of the nation together.
The rich may have known little about the poor
but the country gentlemen as justices have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
obliged to know something. Besides every ratepayer has suffered
when any cause has permanently depressed the labouring
class. All have to pay more poor rates and so are led to discuss,
and if possible to remedy, abuses and grievances. In this way
the evils of bad administration of relief have been checked and
interest in all matters affecting the poor has been stimulated.</p>

<p>But the existence of the poor law may have had even
more important effects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4 <i>b</i>. Decrease
of bitterness
in competition
and increase
of order.</div>

<p>Many are affected by the poor law who never receive relief;
it takes away some of the horror of failure from
all who may if unfortunate need help of the kind
and so renders the struggle for existence less
brutal to the whole of the labouring class.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century this assistance to the poor
helped to make England a peaceful community and it has
probably had the same effect ever since.</p>

<p>The earlier centuries of our history were not distinguished
by the quiet and orderly habits of the people. Whenever, as
in the reigns of Henry III. and Richard II., we had little war
abroad there was disorder at home. In the sixteenth century
we have seen every season of scarcity produce riots, insurrections
or rebellion. In 1529 Norfolk and Kent were in
insurrection, in 1586 Gloucestershire was discontented, in
1596 the peasants of Oxfordshire took up arms; while in
1549 the economic distress was mainly responsible for the
rebellion which caused the fall of the Duke of Somerset and
nearly produced a revolution. Even in ordinary times property
was not safe; bands of vagrants roamed the country who
compelled the inhabitants to grant them relief; petty thefts
were committed and were neither detected nor punished, sometimes
robbery even was successfully attempted in open daylight
and was unrepressed. In Scotland a like state of things lasted
at least as late as the end of the seventeenth century and
indeed much later still. Louise Michelle on her visit to
England was more struck by English poor relief than by
any other English institution: she said that a like system in
France would have prevented the French revolution. The
distress of the masses of the people and the existence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
large number of hungry men always ready to join the forces
of disorder, are at all times a danger to the stability of governments.
It may well be therefore that the law-abiding characteristics
of the nation and the absence of violent changes in
the political constitution have been at least partly due to the
regular relief which has been granted under the English poor
law. Ever since its provisions were first thoroughly put in
execution through the efforts of the Privy Council and of
the justices in the reign of Charles I. no man has been able
truthfully to plead that he was driven to crime or desperation
by absolute want.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX V.</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Part</span> of a draft of orders for remedying the scarcity of
corn in 1586 (Lansdowne MSS. Brit. Mus., No. 48, f. 128).</p></div>

<p>The following draft is found among the Burleigh papers. It
is written on four folio sheets on both sides, for the most part in
an official hand, but throughout it is corrected in Burleigh's own
hand, and the last portion is written entirely by him.</p>

<p>The orders here contained must have been substantially the
same as those issued and printed by order of the Privy Council
on Jan. 4, 1586/7 since a series of reports dated in 1587 answer
these instructions point by point<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>. Most of these regulations were
suggested by the three judges, Popham, Mildmay and Manwood,
to whom the matter had been referred. Their report was considered
and annotated by Burleigh, and the following draft seems
to have been based on their conclusions<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>.</p>

<p>Already several times during the reigns of Edward and
Elizabeth similar sets of orders had been issued in order to
prevent a bread famine in years of high-priced corn. Earlier
in this year of 1586 commands had already been sent, and reports
had been received from the justices. These orders however were
more carefully considered and detailed than any previous commands.</p>

<p>Orders of this kind continued to be issued throughout the
reigns of Elizabeth, James I. and Charles I., but these of
January 1586/7 were thought to have the best effect and were
reprinted and reissued in 1594<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. They thus seem to be the
original form of the scarcity Book of Orders which apparently
afterwards suggested the Book of Orders for the relief of the
Poor of Jan. 1630/1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>A few of the later clauses only of this draft relate directly to
the relief of the poor, and the general character of the instructions
given in these contrast strongly with the detailed directions dealing
with the supply of grain. This bears out the contention that
at this time the direct relief of the poor was only subsidiary to
the indirect relief afforded to the poorer classes by these measures
for the supply of corn: it also indicates that the interference of
the Privy Council in the direct relief of the poor was suggested
by the distress and disorder of these years of high-priced grain,
and was begun at least as early as 1587, as one of the methods
which were adopted to relieve that distress.</p>

and Reipham, Co. Norfolk, 23rd October, 1622 (Brit. Mus.
Add. MSS., No. 12,496, f. 222).</p>

<p>The following orders were enclosed with a letter of Dec.
7th, 1622, written by John Rycherds, one of the justices of
Norfolk, to Sir Julius Caesar<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>. Sir Julius had sent this
justice the letters of the Privy Council, regulating alehouses
and the strength of beer, the 19th October, 1622, and had
asked him to report as to the condition of the country with
regard to the supply of corn. John Rycherds states that
these orders had been made in the "Lymitt" where he
served before the receipt of the letter and that they dealt
with all the matters commanded in the Council's letter.
After the letter had been received, however, the matters
named were again "given in perticuler charge."</p>

That the great owners of Corne aswell farmo<sup>rs</sup> as others do not
thresh out their owne Corne, but buy all they spend or Sowe
either at the Marketts or of poore small farmo<sup>rs</sup> that are constrayned
to sell nowe and yett must buy againe before Harvest
next for their owne expence w<sup>ch</sup> doth both encrease the prices of all
grayne, and by that meanes all the Corne is brought into a fewe
handes who then make the prices at their owne pleasure. If
theis things be provided for and duly putt in execucon, there
wilbee Corne enough found and spared for the people of our

<p>"Whereas wee by special direccons of his Ma<sup>tie</sup> did lately
commend unto yo<sup>r</sup> care the present state of those parts of y<sup>r</sup>
county where the poore clothiers and their workmen at present
destitute of worke might some other way be imployed or for the
tyme be releeved till some obstructions to trade were remooved,
as also to kepe in order those that are loose and ill disposed
people. To w<sup>ch</sup> end his Ma<sup>tie</sup> by advise of his Privie Councell and
the Judges hath lately published a proclamacon declaring his
pleasure and command; in what manner the truly poore and
impotent should be relieved, those of able bodies should be sett
on worke and imployed in honest labors and the sturdie, idle and
dangerous roagues and vagabonds should be repressed and punished
w<sup>ch</sup> proclamacon you shall herew<sup>th</sup> likewise receive. Now, bycause
wee understand that in yo<sup>r</sup> countie there is more than ordinarie
occasion to use all dilligence and industrie at this time, wee have
thought fitt to putt yo<sup>u</sup> more particularlie in minde thereof, and
in answere of yo<sup>r</sup> l(ett)res to lett yo<sup>u</sup> know that it is the resolucon
of all the Judges, that by the lawe yo<sup>u</sup> have sufficient power and
ought to raise meanes out of the severall Parishes if they be of
abilitie, or otherwise in their defect in their severall Hundrethes,
Lathes or Wapentakes, and for want of their abilitie (to sett yo<sup>r</sup>
poore on worke and to relieve the aged and impotent not able to
worke) in the whole bodie of the county, wherefore his Ma<sup>tie</sup>
commands that the wayes provided by lawe in theise cases be
duely followed w<sup>th</sup> all diligence and possible speede. You are
required to understand the true state of the country from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
ministers, churchwardens and overseers of the severall parishes
w<sup>th</sup>in your severall divisions. And what rests herein to be done
by order at the Quarter Sessions, the judges advise that for this
purpose you may call the Quarter Sessions sooner then the
ordinary sett tymes and doe that w<sup>ch</sup> in this case is so requisite.
Further wee lett yo<sup>u</sup> to know, that such hath bin his Ma<sup>t's</sup> care
and personall paines taken to remove theis impediments, that of
late have bin to trade and to open a free vent to the commodities
of yo<sup>r</sup> country, that yo<sup>r</sup>selves will shortily see the fruits of it to
yo<sup>r</sup> comforts neverthelesse in the meane tyme theise things provided
by the lawe and the helpes that by yo<sup>r</sup> care may be added
are in no sorte to bee neglected, but exactly pursued of w<sup>ch</sup> yo<sup>r</sup>
proceedings wee are to bee advertised that so wee may render
account thereof to his Ma<sup>tie</sup>. And so etc.</p>

John Wildbore a Minister in and aboute Tinwell w<sup>th</sup>in that
County to a friend of his here wherein after some mencon by him
made of the present want and miserie sustayned by the poorer
sorte in those parts through the dearth of Corne and the want of
worke, he doth advertize in particular some speeches uttered by a
shoomaker of Uppingham (whose name wee finde not) tending to
the stirring upp of the poore theraboute to a mutiny and
insurreccon. W<sup>ch</sup> informacon was as followeth in hæc verba
"Hearest thou" saith a Shoomaker of Uppingham to a poore
man of Liddington "if thou wilte be secrett I will make a mocon
to thee." "What is yo<sup>r</sup> Mocon?" saith the other. Then said
the Shoomaker "The poore men of Okeham have sent to us poore
men of Uppingham and if you poore men of Liddington will
ioyne w<sup>th</sup> us wee will rise and the poore of Okeham say they can
have all the Armour of the Countrie in theire power w<sup>th</sup>in halfe
an hower, and (in faith saith he) we will ryfle the churles."
Upon consideracon had therof however this Board is not easily
credilous of light reports nor apte to take impression from the
vaine speeches or eiaculacons of some meane and contemptible
persons. Yet because it sorts well w<sup>th</sup> the care and providence

177, No. 31. 21st Dec. 1630).</p>

<p>The following letter is substantially like many other
justices' reports relating to the corn measures of 1629-1631.
This document, like a few others of the same kind, preceded
the issue of the Book of Orders of Jan. 1630/1; and was sent
in answer to previous orders of the Privy Council<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>. It is
addressed on the back "To the right Hon<sup>le</sup> my most hon<sup>d</sup>

we haue furthermore taken care (w<sup>ch</sup> I conceiue to be yo<sup>r</sup> Lo<sup>ps</sup>

of the inquiries of the commissioners on poor relief
appointed in Jan. 1630/1.</p>

their maintenance, the amount paid in salaries to the officials of
the hospital all throw light on the rate of wages and on the cost
of living at this time.</p>

ther did enquire, As by the saide booke of Orders is directed, And
haue vntill this tyme contynewed a three weekes meetinge and

<p>Vppon o<sup>r</sup> enquirie had, seuerall presentm<sup>ts</sup> were made to vs
ag<sup>t</sup> dronkards and such as do sitt tiplinge and drinckinge in Alehouses

sought by gentle meanes to incourrage them, where we find the
lawe to give vs that liberty.</p>

Townes w<sup>th</sup>in the sayd Hundreds, for the apprehendinge of rogues
and vagabons, and have caused them to be punished and conveyed
accordinge to the Statute, and we have comanded a strict and

interfering in order to enforce the distribution to the poor of part of the revenue
of a church. Richard, Bishop of Durham, in the course of the visitation of his
diocese, came to the parish of Wessington. The people there complained that
hospitality was not shown by the Church and that alms were not given to
the poor. The bishop therefore ordered that a portion of the revenue should
be given to the poor, and especially set aside the tithes of the new assarts of
Sir Walter de Wessington for this purpose. <cite>Hist. Man. Com.</cite>, MSS. of
J. R. Ormsby, Esq., 1020 <span class="smcap">B.</span> The statutes of Richard II. and Henry IV. seem
to have aimed at doing exactly what the Bishop did at Wessington, whenever a
living was impropriated by a monastery.</p></div>

The rise in wages was barely 15 p.c. before 1550, though during the next ten
years there is a rise of 30 p.c., so that the rise in wages is less than half that in
the price of provisions.

Father Gasquet quotes several cases in which the revenues of the monasteries
had been diminished by the demands made upon them by those in power. He
quotes a letter from the son of the Duke of Buckingham, showing that in some
cases they seem to have been expected to provide free board and lodging for the
poor relations of wealthy families. "And because," the writer says, "he hath
no dwelling place meet for him to inhabit (he was) fain to live poorly at board in
an Abbey this four years day with his wife and seven children." <cite>Henry VIII.

of the monastic bodies also largely consisted of payments of fixed amounts, and
would be unfavourably affected by the rise in prices, which was especially great
after the alteration of the coinage in 1527.</p></div>

"Now what shall we say of these rich citizens of London? What shall I say of
them? Shall I call them proud men of London, malicious men of London, merciless
men of London? No, no, I may not say so; they will be offended with me then.
Yet must I speak. For is there not reigning in London as much pride, as much
covetousness, as much cruelty, as much oppression and as much superstition
as was in Nebo? Yes, I think, and much more too.... But London was
never so ill as it is now. In times past men were full of pity and compassion,
but now there is no pity; for in London their brother shall die in the streets for
cold, he shall lie sick at the door between stock and stock ... and perish there for
hunger: was there ever more unmercifulness in Nebo? I think not. In times
past, when any rich man died in London they were wont to help the poor
scholars of the Universities with exhibition. When any man died, they would
bequeath great sums of money toward the relief of the poor. When I was
a scholar in Cambridge myself, I heard very good report of London, and knew
many that had relief of the rich men of London: but now I can hear no such
good report, and yet I inquire of it, and hearken for it; but now charity is
waxen cold, none helpeth the scholar, nor yet the poor."</p></div>

persons had been healed "in the meane season" during the past five years.
The list of expenses is interesting because of the light it casts upon the cost of
living in 1552. The diet of the hundred patients is calculated at 2<i>d.</i> the day;
each sister was allowed for her board sixteen pence a week, while the matron
obtained eighteen pence.</p></div>

required repair, and stocks also were provided. We hear frequently of its being
used. In 1567, John Martyn was sentenced to twenty-five stripes for robbing
gardens and misusing a poor "innocent;" while in 1570, "Jane Thornton, one
of the Systers," was sentenced to receive "xii strypes, well layd on." There
are several cases also in which the hospital governors find masters for patients
when they have been cured, or sometimes bind them apprentice. In one case
they apprentice a boy who had been cured of a sore leg, and covenant that "yf
hitt happen the sayd Legg Do brek outt agayn" the boy shall be cured "only of
the chardg of the hospital." Occasionally there are details of the employment
of the inmates. In 1569 a small sum is received from the Matron "for work
done by the poore women and children," and in 1573 "a mocion is made that a
handemyll to grind corne may be provyded to sett the pore to worke to kepe
them from ydelnes." But the arrangements for employment are on a very
small scale and seem only likely to concern patients, or perhaps the people in
the casual ward. Others would be sent to Bridewell. These details are all
derived from Mr Rendle's <cite>Old Southwark</cite>, where much more information, derived
from old records of the hospital, has been printed.</p></div>

required that the corn should be sold in the open market. As a rule it was supposed

"badgers" were allowed to buy corn to sell again. A "forestaller" was one
who bought corn or victuals while it was on the way to a port or market, and so
did not give other buyers an equal chance; an "engrosser" was a dealer who
bought up corn while it was growing, or purchased corn or victuals to sell again;

visitation of his diocese, are similar to other interrogatories of the time, and
indicate the way in which the bishops discharged their functions with regard to
the relief of the poor. The Bishop of Norwich enquired of the priests "whether
they doo exhorte the people to remember the poore after the homelye when they
reade the sentences exhorting the Almose." He enquired of the churchwardens
"whether they know any man that refuseth to contribute to the Almes of the
poore as a thing not rightlie appointed and discorageth other from such
charitable Almes?"
</p>
<p>
There were also questions as to whether a strong chest had been provided for
"the poore men's boxe," and whether it had been fastened in a fit place. Other
enquiries concerned the dues of the poor, such as the payments that had
formerly been made for lights out of movable property and the fines of those
who did not go to church. "Injunctions of John, Bishop of Norwich," 2nd May,
1561.
</p>
<p>
The part taken by the bishops must have been of very considerable importance,
even when they acted only on the ecclesiastical side, and it often happened
that the bishops took a considerable share in the general organisation of relief.
Bishop Ridley, as we have seen, took the leading part in the foundation of three
out of the four royal hospitals of London. This action of the bishop was
exercised on the lines laid down in the statutes, was recommended by the letter
of the Privy Council to the rulers of London in 1569, and was used to develop
the organisation of the towns. It serves to link every part of the new organisation
with the old methods of relief, but became less and less important as more
and more compulsion became necessary for the raising of the funds.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> It was evidently difficult to induce men to become collectors. The time of
their election was often changed, and the fines for refusing to serve continuously
increased. This amounted to 20<i>s.</i> in the 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 2, to 40<i>s.</i> in 2 and
3 Ph. and Mary, c. 5, and to £10 in 5 Eliz. c. 3.</p></div>

Middlesex Sessions held June, 17 Eliz. Thomas Maynerde, Oswald Thompson
and John Barres were brought before the magistrates. On the 18 March in
the same year they had been whipped and burnt through the ear at the Old
Bailey; they were now accused of "being over 18 years old and fit for labour,
but masterless and without any lawful means of livelihood." They pleaded
guilty and were sentenced to be hung. Also on the 6 Feb. 18 Eliz. a woman
was tried for vagrancy and committed for two years to a surety who was her
husband, to be his servant. She was again found wandering, and in October
of the same year was sentenced to be hung. In the ten weeks between 6 Oct.
32 Eliz. and 14 Dec. 33 Eliz. seventy-one persons were sentenced at Middlesex
Sessions to be whipped and branded for vagrancy. Middlesex Sessions Roll,

It is difficult to compare the prices in Devon and Cornwall with the rest of
the counties because the size of the bushel varied in Cornwall and was often
twice as great as that used elsewhere; in Devon also the Winchester measures

cloth trade was connected with the concessions granted to the Merchant
Adventurers. Their privileges forced the English manufacturer to sell cloth to
them only. When there was a slackness in trade these concessions were
always questioned or annulled. In December, 1586, the Company say they will
raise a stock and buy more cloths than they can at present sell so that the
workfolk of Somerset and Wilts can be employed. If this fails they consent
that the trade shall be thrown open. This was apparently afterwards done, but
difficulties were still thrown in the way of the "Merchant strangers." <cite>Privy
Council Register</cite>, p. 237, Sept. 1587. The Earl of Leicester wrote both to
Walsingham and Burleigh on the subject. In his letter to Walsingham he says
the towns of the West, Bristol and Hampton, are falling into decay, and there
is an "exstraeme cry and compleynt of y<sup>e</sup> poore for lack of work such as have
bin sett on work heretofore by clothiers." The cause, the clothiers say, is
because they "can not have reasonable price nor utterance for their cloth in
London." He says that "sondry of the most hablest ... are worthie great favo<sup>r</sup>
and thanks for they to ther great loss kepe more now on than ever they did for
the poor's sake." <cite>Dom. State Papers, Queen Eliz.</cite>, Vol. 200, Nos. 5 and 10.</p></div>

meanes that ar not menconed in these orders that the marketts be well served
and the pore releyved ... duringe this time of dearth." The letters sent with
them stated that the orders were devised because of "Her Majestie's care for
the releefe of the poore in this tyme of derthe." See note above. Many
reports show that the orders were intended to help the poor. One from
Kington, Warwickshire, is signed by the Sir Thomas Lucy of Shakespearian
fame and by Richard Verney. The report is said to be sent "in the execution
of the orders sett downe by the lords of her mat<sup>s</sup> moste honorable privie

the inhabitants of the Town of Cambridge seeking their own private gain with
the public hurt and incommodity of the whole University and Town have
heretofore accustomed to build and erect houses upon sundry spare grounds in
and about the said Town; but of late and at this present especially they do not
only increase and continue the same but do more usually divide one house into
many small tenements and those for the most part do let and hire out to the
meanest and poorest persons, which tenements ... are a means ... as we are
informed whereby the University and Town are overburthened in yearly allowance
towards the maintenance of the poor." The Mayor and Vice-chancellor
therefore with the assistance of the "best and discretest persons and officers of
the University and Town" are to cause inquiry to be made as to how many
tenements there are and as to how many people inhabit them, and are also to find
out if the tenements had been built or divided within ten years. They were
then to take measures to alter as many tenements and to remove as many of
the inmates as they should deem expedient. The letter is dated June 8th, 1584,
and is signed by Burghley, Walsingham, and several other members of the
Privy Council. Cooper, <cite>Annals of Cambridge</cite>, Vol. <span class="smcap">II.</span> p. 398.</p></div>

of Norwich is derived from two large folio volumes. They are in manuscript
and are bound in leather. One is entitled "The Maiores Booke for the Poore."
Inside the cover is written "This booke made in the feaste of St John the
Baptiste 1576. In the xviii<sup>th</sup> yere of the rayne of our soveraigne Ladie
Elizabeth by the grace of god quene of Enland, France and Irelande defender
of the faithe and dothe containe certaine orders made for the poore of the

of the Deaconnes and collectors, tharefore appoyntede, in everie warde to
receive and make distribution thereof, according to the same orders, and
accordinge to the commandemente of Mr Maior and the Justices from tyme to
tyme." This book is continued down to the year 1579. The second book
contains the proceedings from 1571 to 1580. Both volumes often contain the
same entries in almost the same words; the census is given only in the first
volume, the orders are fully quoted only in the second. The contents of the
"wrighting" to the Archbishop of Canterbury are given in different versions in
both books. Besides this there is a little book containing in rougher notes the
list of poor who are to depart the City, to receive money or to be placed with
the "select women." Lastly there is a loose paper containing the accounts of
the different collectors, with the aldermen of the wards.</p></div>

of Boston who has offered to set 400 poor people of Lincoln on work for five
years at wool, if the city will find him a convenient house and lend him 300<i>l.</i>
freely for the five years."
</p>
<p>
p. 17. Among the manuscripts described is a "fragment consisting of eight
small quarto leaves of a book of orders made in 1591 and 1592 respecting a
knitting school established by the city." This contains the following information:
</p>
<p>
8th Oct. 1591. Cheeseman undertakes under certain conditions to teach a
competent number of women and men how to knit and "to hide nothing from
them that belongeth to the knowledge of the said science." Four aldermen
were appointed overseers.
</p>
<p>
28 July, 1592. Forty stone of wool to be provided.
</p>
<p>
4 Aug. 1592. Articles of agreement made at the Knitters House in St
Saviourgate between John Cheeseman and Francis Newby.
</p>
<p>
In this agreement Francis Newby and his wife Jane undertook to attend
regularly at Cheeseman's house to learn his trade of knitting, spinning, dressing
of wool and keeping his mill. Newby and his wife were to have the oversight
and teaching of thirty scholars. They were to be paid 40<i>s.</i>, twopence for every
pair of stockings knitted by a scholar and the full price of their own work.
They were also to have such profit as might arise from "amending and footing
all stockings" brought unto them.
</p>
<p>
On the same day it was agreed by the Corporation that the Knitter should be
paid 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for ten wheels which he had provided and the overseers arranged
to visit the school in turn.
</p>
<p>
This Lincoln school very closely resembles the experiment tried at St Albans.
It shows the corporation attempting to provide employment and technical
education at the same time for the children of the town.</p></div>

and true humiliation; to forbear all excess; to relieve the poor and needy by
good house-keeping, by setting them on work and by other deeds of alms and
brotherly compassion. And considering the most princely and gracious care
her Majesty hath for their relief, and that all good means should be used for
the succour and help of them in these times of dearth, the people must be
taught to endure this scarcity with patience; and especially to beware, how
they give ear to any persuasions or practices of discontented and idle brains, to
move them to repine or swerve from the humble duties of good subjects." The
double purpose of helping the poor and maintaining order may be observed in
this letter of the archbishop as well as in the direct orders of the Privy Council.</p></div>

were raised to buy corn, and it is always stated that this corn was bought for
the poor. In 1594 a loan of £200 was so raised, and the town consented to
bear any loss: the next year £600 was thought necessary and three hundred
quarters of rye were purchased. On the 15th Oct. 1596, it was ordered that
"100 quarters of rye and 150 quarters of barley shall be bought for provision
for the poor and so much money as the same shall be valued at shall be lent by

<p><a name="Footnote_301" id="Footnote_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_301"><span class="label">[301]</span></a> The effect of the years of scarcity in stimulating the vigour of the justices
is illustrated by a set of orders agreed upon by the justices of the peace of
Cornwall in April 1597. A copy was sent by Sir Francis Godolphin to Sir
Robert Cecil.
</p>
<p>
The orders first provide for a survey of all the poor which was to distinguish
between those who could earn part of their subsistence and those who were
altogether incapable and also for a list of the householders who could contribute
to their relief. The constables and chief governors of the parish were to state
whether they would themselves undertake the relief of the parish or whether the
justices should levy a weekly rate for the purpose. After arrangements for supporting
the poor had thus been made beggars were to be severely punished, fines
for absence from church were to be rigorously exacted and the fast of two meals
weekly was to be carefully observed. The orders further command an arrangement
like that known as the "roundsman" system for the unemployed: "Such
poor as cannot provide work for themselves are to present themselves in a
convenient place in the church on the Sabbath day a little before the ending of
morning and evening prayer and as soon as prayer is ended order shall be taken
to send them abroad among such householders as shall maintain them meat,
work and such wages as they can deserve for the week following" (<cite>Hatfield
MSS.</cite> <span class="smcap">VII.</span> p. 161). These measures were taken before the statute of 1597 was
passed, and, in accordance with the statute of 1572, the justices and not the
overseers were to make the rate. They show an improvement in Cornish poor
relief, not dependent on the statute of 1597 but like the statute itself brought
into existence by the distress of the years of scarcity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_302" id="Footnote_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302"><span class="label">[302]</span></a>
Other differences between the two Acts were as follows:</p>


<p class="center">1597-8.</p>


<ul><li>(1) Four Overseers were to be nominated
yearly in Easter week.</li>


<li>(2) Every inhabitant or occupier of
lands in the parish was to be assessed.</li>


<li>(3) People refusing to work were to
be sent to the House of Correction.</li>


<li>(4) A girl might be apprenticed
until 21.</li>


<li>(5) In 1597-8 the Mayors or Head
Officers of Corporate Towns being
justices of the peace had the same
authority within their towns as justices
of the peace in the country.</li>


<li>(6) If a parish be in two counties
or partly in a county and partly in a
borough the justices or head officers
of the towns were to "deal and intermeddle"
only within their own "Liberty."</li>
</ul>



<p class="center">1601.</p>


<ul>
<li>(1) Four, three or two Overseers
were to be nominated according to the
size of the parish in Easter week or
within a month after Easter.</li>


<li>(2) In 1601, the liability of the
parish, vicar, owner of tithes impropriate
and of saleable underwoods and
of the occupiers of houses is specially
mentioned.</li>


<li>(3) In 1601 they might be sent to
the House of Correction or gaol, probably
because there was not yet everywhere
a House of Correction.</li>


<li>(4) If she married she was released
at the time of her marriage.</li>


<li>(5) In 1601, these powers were extended
and the Town officials had not
only the same authority as the justices
out of their sessions and at their
sessions, but the same power as was
appointed "to any two or more of them
or to the justices of the peace in their
Quarter Sessions." Every Alderman
of the City of London in his Ward
had the same power as one or two
justices in the county.</li>


<li>(6) If the parish were in two counties
or partly in a county and partly
in a borough there were only the one
set of Overseers, but the justices or
Mayors &amp;c. were to be responsible for
the execution of the Act only within
the part of the parish in their own
counties or borough and the Overseers
were to account to both.</li>

<li>(7) In 1601 the penalty on justices
for neglecting to nominate Overseers
was fixed at £5.
</li>

<li>(8) A special order was made that
the island of Foulness should be treated
as a parish.</li>


<li>(9) It was also provided that if an
action for trespass should be brought
against anyone acting in accordance
with the provisions of the statute, it
should be lawful for him to plead
"Not Guilty" or to plead the authority
of the Act. He was to be entitled to
treble damages "by reason of his
wrongfull vexacon."</li>
</ul>

<p>
Between the passing of these two Acts a series of resolutions was circulated
which related to the statute of 1597. These were attributed to the judges and if
they correctly stated the law several of the new clauses of 1601 were already
legally binding. Thus four of the resolutions were as follows:
</p>

<p>Res. 16. By this word parents is understoode a father or a grandfather,
mother or grandmother, being persons able.</p>


<p>Res. 17. Within the word children is included any childe, or grandchilde,
being able.</p>


<p>Res. 18. Parsons or Vicars &amp;c. bee bound (as inhabitants) to the relief of
the poore as wel as others that inhabite within the parish.</p>


<p>Res. 19. Everie one that hath Tithes impropriate, coale mines or lands in
manuel occupation &amp;c. is chargeable. And so for such as haue saleable woods
proportioning the same to an annual benefite.</p>

passed during the period 1597 to 1644:
</p>
<p>
1 James I. c. 7. Removes the exemption of glassmen from the statute
of rogues. States that no licence by a nobleman shall exempt players and provides
for the branding and in certain cases for the death of dangerous rogues.
</p>
<p>
1 James I. c. 25. Continues 43 Eliz. c. 2 and provides that masters may
retain the pauper apprentices whom the Overseers have bound to them.
</p>
<p>
7 James I. c. 3. Enacts various provisions with the object of securing
that funds which had been left to bind poor children apprentices shall be
properly employed.
</p>
<p>
21 James I. c. 1. States that the licence to erect "abiding or working
houses for the poor" is to continue for ever.
</p>
<p>
21 James I. c. 28. Continues 43 Eliz. c. 3, with addition of 1 Jac. I. c. 25.
Also continues 1 James I. c. 7, and 7 James I. c. 4, repeals 11 Hen. VII. c. 2,
and 19 Hen. VII. c. 19, 12 Ric. II. cc. 3-9, and also 22 Hen. VIII. c. 12 and
3 and 4 Edw. VI. c. 16.
</p>
<p>
3 Chas. I. c. 5. Continues 43 Eliz. c. 2, and empowers Overseers to set
up any trade they will, provided it is only for the purpose of employing the poor,
notwithstanding any statute to the contrary. This last enactment was probably
designed to protect the Overseers from penalties for violating the statute of
apprenticeship.

of the poor. Some of these are as follows:

Dalton, p. 99. It is interesting to notice that a case concerning the present law
on this point has been recently before the Courts. The Guardians of the poor
in Merthyr Tydfil established labour yards and relief works for the purpose
of affording outdoor relief to able-bodied persons during a strike. An action
was brought by, and on behalf of, the ratepayers of the district against the
Guardians asking for a declaration that the establishment of relief works for the
purpose of providing outdoor relief for able-bodied persons during a strike was
a breach of the Guardians' statutory rights and duties, and also asking for an
injunction to restrain the defendants from paying for these relief works out of
the common fund when there was plenty of work to be had if the men would
agree to accept the wages offered.
</p>
<p>
It was held by Lord Justice Romer that in any case of urgent necessity an
able-bodied man or his family ought to have such relief from the Guardians as
might be immediately required, even if the necessity had arisen from the man
wilfully refusing to work. But when the urgent pressure was relieved, the
Guardians ought to require the man to work, and if he were able to get work and
still refused they ought to prosecute him under the Vagrancy Acts. It was also
decided that though the Court had jurisdiction in an action at the instance of
the ratepayers to restrain Guardians from applying the poor rates for unauthorised
purposes, still such an action should not be instituted for the purpose of asking
the Court whether the Guardians had been right or wrong in granting relief in
particular cases. The proper course for the ratepayers to take when objecting
to expenditure was to go before the auditors appointed by the Local Government
Board or to appeal to the Local Government Board itself. In the present case
no instance of relief given except for urgent necessity had been proved and no
instances of improper relief had been brought before the Court. The action
therefore was dismissed. Attorney-General and others <i>v.</i> Merthyr Tydfil
Guardians, March 27th, 1899. <cite>Weekly Notes</cite>, April 1st, p. 38.</p></div>

Somerset state that the corn riots are now suppressed, but that the want of
work tends to mutiny. <cite>Cal. of State Papers</cite>, May 14th, 1622. The justices of
Wilts reply that some of the clothiers have dismissed their workpeople and
there are now 8000 out of work; some of them have attacked and seized corn
on its way to market and further outrages are feared. <cite>Cal. of State Papers</cite>,
April 30th, 1622. In consequence of this distress inquiry was ordered. A committee
of the Privy Council was appointed to find out the causes of the decay of
trade and to suggest remedies. Representative clothiers were to be sent from
every county to the Council, and the Merchant Adventurers were to appoint
some of their number to confer with the committee. In May it was settled
that if the Eastland merchants did not buy the cloths the merchants might do
so themselves, and in October an important committee was appointed to
consider the whole matter.</p></div>

given in the form of answers to questions submitted to the judges on particular
points of law. They decided among other things, that a man must take an
apprentice if the justices so ordered whether payment were made or not; that
all the lands in the parish must be rated equally, but that an extra sum might be
levied from a man "for his visible ability" within the parish; and also various
points concerning settlement. One question and answer are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<i>Qu.</i> If one who is under the age of 30 years and brought up in husbandry
or a maid servant, or brought up in any of the arts or trades mentioned in the
statute, 5 Eliz. cap. 4, and not enabled according to that stat. to live at his or
her own hand, shall be warned by two justices of the peace to put him or her
self in service by a day prescribed by them, and shall not doe the same accordingly,
but shall after continue living at his or her own hand, what course shall
be taken with such a person and how punished?
</p>
<p>
<i>Resol.</i> Such persons being out of service, and not having visible means of
their own, to maintain themselves without their labour, and refusing to serve
as a hired servant, by the yeer, may be bound over to the next Sessions or
Assises, and to be of good behaviour in the mean time, or may be sent to the
house of correction. These resolutions of the judges are quoted by Dalton as
having great authority.</p></div>

<p>
1622. Vagrants are again "kept for Virginia."
</p>
<p>
April 1635. It is ordered "that if Mr George Whitmore and the Treasurer
shall think fit to send any vagrants beyond seas, what reasonable they shall
consent unto shall be allowed." At the same meeting some parishioners
agreed to pay for a certain inhabitant of their parish to go beyond seas.
</p>
<p>
At the meetings held later in the month on April 15th and 29th several
people are destined for Virginia and others for the Barbadoes.
</p>
<p>
Other entries occur in 1639.
</p>
<p>
The names of all these vagrants are given, and the descendants of several
of them occupy good positions in America. An enterprising American has
endeavoured to enlighten his countrymen on the subject, but the publication of
names is now forbidden as the descendants did not care to be enlightened.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_615" id="Footnote_615"></a><a href="#FNanchor_615"><span class="label">[615]</span></a> The supposition that the town stock was used in Bassetlaw for employing
the poor seems almost certain for the following reasons:
</p>
<p>
(1) In the earlier entries this is often directly stated to be the case. Thus
we are told at Laneham that the "towne stocke" was used to buy hemp "to
sett such poore on worke as wante."
</p>
<p>
(2) When a town stock is reported not to exist other methods of employing
the poor are sometimes mentioned as a reason for the absence of such a stock,
and thus it is implied that a town stock when it existed was used for this
purpose. Thus for example at Grove they have "no towne stock in regard,
theire poore are otherwise sett on worke;" at Egmonton "Towne stock they
haue none because they imploy theire poore in other worke as they wante;"
while at Laxton cum Morehouse there was no stock because those who wanted
work were otherwise employed "by the towne."
</p>
<p>
(3) There is an earlier report from Bassetlaw sent in on July 29th, 1636.
This report relates to fewer places, but in some respects is fuller. In eleven
cases where only the amount of the stock is noted in 1637, the fact that it was
employed to provide work is directly stated in 1636. Thus for example the
following entries occur:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Askham. "Five marks stocke to sett the poore on worke." (20 marks 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Kirton. "Tenn pounds in Towne stocke wherew<sup>th</sup> the poore are sett on
worke and two new howses built for them."
</p>
<p>
Clarebrough (Clarborough). "They have iii<sup>li</sup> vi<sup>s</sup> viii<sup>d</sup> towarde releiueing the
poore and setting the(m) on worke."
</p>
<p>
Misterton cu(m) Stockw<sup>th</sup> (Stockwith). "That their Towne stocke is Tenn
pounds towards setting their poore on worke and releiveing them."
</p>
<p>
East Markham. "And that they haue 5<sup>li</sup> in stocke to sett the poore on
worke." (£7 in 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Bole. "5<sup>li</sup> Towne stocke w<sup>ch</sup> is imployed to sett poore on worke."
</p>
<p>
Warsopp (Warsop). "They haue in Towne stocke to sett their poore on
worke xi<sup>li</sup> iiij<sup>s</sup>." (£11 in 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Cuckney. "They have tenn pounds Towne stocke to sett their poore on
worke." (£7 in 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Carberton (Carburton). "They haue in Stocke to maintain their poore in
worke fifty shillings." (40<i>s.</i> in 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Mattersey. "They haue 5<sup>li</sup> towne stocke to sett their poore on worke."
(£10 in 1637.)
</p>
<p>
Eakring. "Tenn pounds in Towne stocke w<sup>ch</sup> is putt out for vse of the
poore. And the 7<sup>th</sup> of June the(y) (the overseers) certifie that they haue raysed
xx<sup>s</sup> stocke to sett poore on worke and giue weekely allowance to six poore
people," besides 40<sup>s</sup>. more for placing apprentices.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In these eleven cases therefore the town stock was certainly used for employing
the poor. In four other instances, however, a general statement is
made as to the use of the stock which perhaps indicates that the whole of the
stock was not always employed entirely for one purpose. Thus for example at
Eaton £2. 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> was "in stocke for such poore as should neede." However
in no case do these statements contradict the supposition that the town stock
in this district was partially used for finding employment for the poor, and the
direct statement of the 1636 report in these eleven cases is strong evidence that
in the remaining nine places the stock was used in the same fashion.</p></div>

recorded in any of the justices' reports which have been preserved, we hear
from other sources that work was found for the poor in some places in those
counties. Thus the following memorandum refers to an attempt to establish a
workhouse in Plymouth; it is to be found among the municipal records in that
town. "In the name of god the 28th of September an<sup>o</sup> 1610 A note of provisio<sup>ns</sup>
delivred into y<sup>e</sup> Castle for the pore to thende they maye be there placed

<p>
Two years later £20 was bequeathed by W. Lawrence "to the stocke to sett
y<sup>e</sup> poor to worke," and early in the reign of Charles I. a "workehowse for the
setting of the poore on worke" has been lately built and the overseers paid the
corporation £9. 12<i>s.</i> for the rent of the three tenements which formerly had
existed on the site. R. N. Worth, <cite>Plymouth Municipal Records</cite>, pp. 156 and
257, and <cite>Hist. of Plymouth</cite>, p. 273.
</p>
<p>
In Marlborough also there was certainly a workhouse, for a petition was
presented to the Privy Council in the name of the Mayor and burgesses
concerning John Thorner, an Attorney-at-Law, who "was rated among others
to pay 52/- towards the erecting of a workhouse and raising of a stock for
the employment of the poore that are able and willing to worke to be paid at
three general payments whereof one is already passed at our Lady day last."
Thorner had refused to pay his rate, "saying that it was against the law," and
had encouraged others not to pay, so "that manie of the inhabitants there made
refusall also to pay their proportion." The Privy Council referred the matters
to the judges, and in the mean time the rate was to be paid. <cite>Privy Council
Register</cite>, 13th May, 1631.</p></div>

Scottish boroughs held in Aberdeen July 1580, representatives of certain towns
were deputed to ask his Majesty to take measures "for taking of ordour with
euery parochyn to landwart for sustening of thair awin pure people and impotent

Marwick, <cite>Convention of Scottish Boroughs</cite>, <span class="smcap">I.</span>, p. 102. In some towns
however measures were taken. In Glasgow as early as 1575 badges were provided
for the town beggars, and the rest were banished. Marwick, <cite>Extracts
from the Records of the Borough of Glasgow</cite>, <span class="smcap">I.</span>, p. 457. Occasionally also payments
were made from the town chest to particular poor people both before and
after 1597. Thus the following entries occur in the borough accounts:

In Aberdeen in 1595 more organised relief was attempted. The whole town
on Jan. 23rd, 1595 met together and the poor were divided into four classes,
(1) "babis," (2) "decayit persones hous halderis," (3) "leamit and impotent
persones, (4) "sic as war decrepit and auld" if bred and born in the town or
resident there for seven years. The inhabitants then agreed some to receive

in their homes, and orders the inhabitants to be "stented" for their relief. In
Jan. 1639 the rate was imposed and amounted to £600, or one-fifth of the
ordinary taxation. In April the poor were to be "keipit in thair houssis for
ane quarter to cum," and in October the arrangement was said to be successful,
and was continued for a year. But in 1647 the town authorities say they are
loath to take the course allowed by law, and ask the kirk session to "fallow
furthe the way on ane voluntar monethlie contributione"; any deficiency in the
sum necessary for the poor was however still to be contributed by the town.
In 1649 means were formed of stimulating the voluntary contributors "Anent
the inbringing of the poores mentinance it is inacted that the refuissars be
quarterit vpon with sojouries." Still the funds raised were insufficient, and in
1653 a tax was again imposed only to be again discontinued a few years later.

also we have a report which shows that the country was becoming quiet, though
the good order is often attributed to the watches for vagrants. "Watches and
warde have beene and are continued whereby the number of vagabonds are
much diminished and this country thereby well freed." Vol. 289, No. 20.
Also from the wapentakes of Stancliff and Ewecross, co. York, we hear there
are "verie fewe or none to bee founde wanderinge or rogeinge." Vol. 364,
No. 49. Although in these cases the improvement is attributed to punishment
rather than relief, it probably indicates that relief also was well administered
since neither justices nor inhabitants could or would prevent vagabondage by
punishment unless it were accompanied by efficient poor relief.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_730" id="Footnote_730"></a><a href="#FNanchor_730"><span class="label">[730]</span></a> Between 1600 and 1688 wages rise continuously in every decade. If we
take the decennial averages of labour given by Prof. Rogers we find that
between the accession of James I. and 1688 in most cases the greatest increase
of wages was during the period from 1643 to 1652. But this increase may be
largely owing to the disturbances of the Civil War, since from 1663 to 1672 the
rate of increase is less than that of any preceding ten years of the century.
With the exception of the decade of the Civil War the greatest rise in wages
occurs during the ten years immediately preceding, from 1633 to 1642, that is
during the time when the organisation established by the Book of Orders was
established. Moreover the increase is the more remarkable when we compare
the rates of wages with the price of corn. For from 1633-1642 the average
price of wheat per quarter was 41<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, while from 1643-1652 it was 48<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>,
and during the next ten years 47<i>s.</i> 2&frac14;<i>d.</i> <cite>Hist. of Agric. and Prices</cite>, Vol. <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
p. 276. The average price of wheat was therefore considerably lower during the
decade before the War. The following are the decennial averages of the worst
paid labour given by Prof. Rogers, <cite>Hist. of Agric. and Prices</cite>, Vol. <span class="smcap">V.</span>, p. 672:

It will be seen that wages rose slowly before 1632, and then began to rise at
a much more rapid rate, and that the wages of unskilled labour rose almost as
much during the decade 1633 to 1642 as during the ten years in which the war
was conducted.</p></div>

especially to dealers in corn and other provisions. By the 5 and 6 Edw. VI.
c. 14 badgers and kidders or kyddiers licensed by three justices were exempted
from the penalties attached to forestallers and regrators; no one not so
licensed might buy corn to sell again. In a statute of Elizabeth (5 Eliz.
c. 12) they are again mentioned and the conditions of their license were
made more stringent; no one was to be licensed unless he were a resident
householder and the licensed dealer had to place security with the Clerk of
the Peace that he would not forestall or engross corn. The words "badger"
and "kidder" continued to be used in the licenses granted to corndealers as
late as the eighteenth century. The word "brogger" does not occur so
frequently. Murray states that it is apparently an unexplained corruption
of broker, and he quotes Stow's Survey (1754), <span class="smcap">II.</span> <span class="smcap">V.</span> <span class="smcap">XV.</span> "They were called
Broggers in a statute of Richard II.&mdash;none to be Brocars in any mystery
unless chosen by the same mystery." See also 25 Hen. VIII. c. 1, where
the word is applied to a seller of meat.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_762" id="Footnote_762"></a><a href="#FNanchor_762"><span class="label">[762]</span></a> All these inquiries refer to the statute of Elizabeth concerning
labourers (5 Eliz. c. 4) or to the clause in the poor law of 1601 (43 Eliz.
c. 2) which ordered the overseers to set to work all persons who had no
means to maintain themselves. See above, pp. 140, 161. Some of the
regulations of the former statute provide that in many employments
servants should not be retained for less than a year; that the rates of
wages should be fixed by the justices in Quarter Sessions every year; that a
quarter's warning should be given if either master or servant desired to
terminate the engagement at the end of the term, and that a testimonial
should be obtained by a servant before he left his own parish or town, and
should be shown to his new master before he obtained a fresh engagement.
The statute also settled the conditions of apprenticeship, and limited the
right of becoming an apprentice in certain crafts to the sons of those who
possessed a little property. It also provided that all persons between
twelve and sixty not otherwise employed, might be compelled to serve in
husbandry. Several other references to the execution of this statute occur
in the reports here printed. See B., Westmill and Sawbridgeworth, also D
and E.</p></div>

Stansted Abbots are of any size; Eastwick has even now only 71 inhabitants,
and neither Gilston, Westmill or Thundridge have a population
exceeding 500. The population of Charles I.'s time for the whole of
England and Wales is estimated to have been about one-sixth that of the
present day. The largest place, Ware, has a stock when the reports begin,
the second in size, Stortford, reports one at the second meeting, while the
overseers of Braughing have arranged for the employment of the poor in
another manner. Here therefore as elsewhere arrangements for finding
work exist more in the larger places than in the smaller.</p></div>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
